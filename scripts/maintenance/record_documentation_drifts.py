"""Record two document-vs-implementation drifts with measured numbers and git-resolved SHAs.

1. The governance prose still speaks of 15/16 lanes; the production registry has 21 entries
   plus the synthetic overview lane = 22 reachable views. Measured, not asserted.
2. The atlas gap card lists AG-01..AG-08 with no live status, so the coverage matrix shows
   them PLANNED/UNVERIFIED while the fixes landed on 2026-10-01. The card is a frozen
   planning record and stays untouched; the row below is the dated correction.
