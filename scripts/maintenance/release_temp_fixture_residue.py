"""Reclaim orphaned throwaway fixtures under the bounded temp root, keeping live ones in place.

`project_temp.fixture_dir()` registers each root it creates and releases them from an at-exit hook, so
a run that exits normally leaves nothing behind — measured 2026-10-08 by running
`tests/workflow-assistance/test_cleanup.py` (17 tests, 17 fixtures created and released, count
unchanged). What accumulates is a different thing: a gate job that is killed, times out or crashes
never reaches at-exit, and its fixtures then have **no owner at all**. Nothing in the repository
looked at them until now, so the root held 4811 directories / 531.7 MiB, 676 of them carrying a nested
`.git` whose mode-0444 object files made even an explicit `shutil.rmtree` fail (WinError 5) — a failure
that `ignore_errors=True` used to swallow.

Order of operations, because deletion is not reversible:

1. measure: every candidate directory, its size, its age, and its contents count;
2. write the manifest, then delete only what the manifest lists;
3. an age floor (`--older-than-hours`, default 6) protects a fixture belonging to a session that is
   running *right now* in this checkout — this tool must never be able to break a concurrent run;
4. release goes through `project_temp.force_release`, the one implementation that clears git's
   read-only bits and reports `TEMP_RESIDUE_NOT_REMOVED` instead of hiding a refusal.

`--apply` is required to delete; without it the tool is a dry run that writes the manifest only. The
bound gate `tests/ci/test_temp_fixture_residue_is_bounded.py` is what makes the pile un-regrowable.
Only paths inside the project Git root are eligible; anything else, including `E:\\` and `F:\\`, is
refused outright.

Two scratch families are censused, because a killed gate job leaves both behind and only one of them is a
`project_temp` fixture: the bounded temp root, and the per-run Chrome profile directories the geometry gate
creates under `.project-local/runs/geometry-gate/` (a browser that is killed mid-capture cannot clean its own
profile, and 2026-10-25 found one still sitting there). A profile is released only after its own age floor and
only through the same refusal-reporting path, so a live Chrome cannot lose a directory under its feet.

The manifest name carries the mode, a microsecond stamp and a collision counter, and every write is
create-exclusive: a dry run that lands in the same second as an applied release used to overwrite it and
erase the record of what was deleted (measured 2026-10-25 -- both runs printed the same manifest path).

Usage:
    python scripts/maintenance/release_temp_fixture_residue.py [--apply] [--older-than-hours N]
Exit: 0 dry run or completed release; 1 a candidate could not be released; 2 refused.
