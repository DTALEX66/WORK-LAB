"""Audit every tracked-document citation of a `.project-local` path and classify the absent ones.

Why this exists: `docs/audits/RELEASED_BROWSER_STATE_2026-10-07.json` recorded "28 tracked documents
cite `.project-local` paths that no longer exist" from one narrow scan. A full-tree scan gives 200
absent tokens, so the number is an artefact of the scanner's scope, not a count of broken promises.
The only thing that matters is whether a record claims *evidence is available here* while the file
is gone, so this script separates the real class from the four decoy classes and writes a durable,
re-runnable answer.
