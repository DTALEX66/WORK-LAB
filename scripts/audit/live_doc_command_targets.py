"""Scan the LIVE instruction surfaces for commands that point at a path which no longer exists.

A sentence describing an old layout is history and stays. A line that reads like something to run is
an instruction, and an instruction whose target is absent fails for whoever follows it. This is the
U02 path-convergence question asked as a machine check instead of a recollection: ERR-115 recorded
that `scripts/workflow/…` had moved, round D fixed the scripts that called it, and the *documents*
were never re-asked — 79 dead command references across 19 re-pointable paths and 14 that need a
human reason were still sitting in `docs/current/` and the managed skill references.

Surfaces: README.md, AGENTS.md, docs/current/**, config/**, packages/client-neutral-core/skills/**,
bin/**, apps/observer/README.md + module-profile.json. JSON ledgers and registries are deliberately
NOT scanned line-by-line: their `command` fields are history by contract (ERR-130) and their
promise-bearing fields already have their own gates.

Usage:
    python scripts/audit/live_doc_command_targets.py            # report
    python scripts/audit/live_doc_command_targets.py --apply     # re-point MAP entries in place
    python scripts/audit/live_doc_command_targets.py --json PATH

Exit: 0 clean, 1 dead references remain (report mode), 2 the scan itself could not run.
