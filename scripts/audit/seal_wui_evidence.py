"""Seal the WUI evidence directory against the bytes the front end is built from right now.

A render receipt is a claim about a bundle, not about a commit. On 2026-10-10 the Observer `dist` was
rebuilt (a production source change landed after the captures) and every screenshot, geometry, legibility,
DPI and keyboard receipt in `.project-local/artifacts/wui-20261009` silently became a description of bytes
that no longer existed. Nothing in the tree said so, and a reader had no way to tell "measured" from
"measured, then superseded".

This script makes the difference machine-visible: it walks the evidence set, reads the bundle identity each
receipt carries (`servedBundle.bundleDigest` from the CDP instruments, `distBundle.sha256` from the native
keyboard gate), and sorts every file BOUND / STALE / UNBOUND against the digest computed from `dist` right
now. A PNG has no self-describing bundle, so it is bound through the receipt that lists it.
