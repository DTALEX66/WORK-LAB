"""Name the exact bytes a rendered measurement looked at.

A CDP receipt says what the DOM did; nothing in it says WHICH bundle produced that DOM. That gap is not
academic -- on 2026-10-10 the Observer `dist` was rebuilt after every screenshot and geometry receipt had
already been written, so a whole set of "measured" claims described bytes that no longer existed, and the
receipts could not tell the difference. `GATE_HEAD` binds a gate report to a commit; this binds a render
report to the files the browser actually fetched.

The identity covers every file the built page can load -- `index.html` plus everything under `dist/assets`
-- because the entry chunk pulls two more chunks dynamically (`window-*.js`, `webview-*.js`) that
`index.html` never mentions. Hashing only what the HTML references would leave a change to those two
invisible, and the point of a binding is that it moves when the bytes the browser ran move.
