"""Adjudicate every unbound PASS record whose recorded check contains a gone path.

"PATH_GONE" as a single label per record hides three different situations: the guard was moved (so the claim
still has a home and only the citation is stale), the guard was deleted outright (so the PASS has no check
behind it any more), and only one operand of a multi-operand command is gone while the rest still resolve.
This separates them by looking at every operand the command names, by searching the tree for the missing
basename, and by asking git whether that exact path was ever deleted.
