"""Make every path cited in the DEFAULT-LOAD documents followable from the repository root.

WUI-17's clause is narrow on purpose: "from now on only handle consumers that still affect default
loading". A document a new session is told to read is exactly such a consumer, and a citation it cannot
open is a dead end at the top of the chain. Measured 2026-10-10 across the seven documents the audit
bootstrap names: 167 backticked path citations, of which 30 were bare filenames or front-end-relative
shorthands (they resolve to a real file, but only for someone who already knows where to look) and 14 more
were ambiguous-by-name -- `BOUNDARY.md` exists under three service roots, so a reader cannot tell which one
the sentence means. Frozen history (`docs/history/**`, `taskpacks/history/**`) is NOT in scope: those files
are evidence about their own date, and rewriting them would be editing provenance.

This tool rewrites what resolves uniquely, and refuses on anything ambiguous or unresolved so a human
decision is recorded instead of guessed. Pass --apply to write.
