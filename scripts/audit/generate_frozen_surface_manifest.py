"""Generate a byte-checkable FROZEN manifest for a closed history surface.

Why this exists: DOCUMENT-CENSUS §7.3 asked for FROZEN declarations for the frozen surfaces, and the
repository already carries three archive conventions of which exactly one
(`reports/audit-archive/20260930/ARCHIVE-INDEX.json`) can be checked to the byte. A "frozen" claim that
nothing re-derives is a sentence, not a control: the census itself had already gone stale about one of
these directories (`90-archive/` is described as holding frozen reports and now contains one marker
file). So this emits the same field names the checkable convention uses — `path`, `bytes`, `sha256` —
and `tests/ci/test_frozen_surfaces_are_intact.py` re-derives and compares them on every gate run.

Determinism: entries are sorted by path and the payload carries no timestamp; the two git identities
that pin the snapshot (commit and tree) are recorded instead, because they are re-derivable on any
machine while a wall-clock string is not.
