"""Proof instrument: the licence audit as it first shipped contradicted its own entries.

Not a CI gate — exit 1 IS the finding, and that is the point. The first version of
`docs/audits/LICENCE_READBACK_2026-10-07.json` said in prose that only three rows were confirmed by
opening the licence file, while the very same document's `method` fields listed six. A reader who
trusted the sentence would have re-fetched three files and trusted eleven. This script reads the
audit **as committed at the revision that introduced it** (a tracked blob, so it does not depend on
any scratch directory or on the working tree) and shows the two numbers disagreeing.

Usage: python scripts/audit/prove_previous_licence_audit_miscounted_the_files.py [REV]
Exit: 1 when the historical text is contradicted by its own data (the defect), 0 if it agrees,
      2 when the revision or file cannot be read.
