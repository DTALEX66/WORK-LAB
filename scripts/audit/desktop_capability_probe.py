"""W04 (2026-10-17): probe the DESKTOP CAPABILITY, in layers, without touching the product.

Why this exists
---------------
U19's verdict was derived from GitHub job flags, a passing backend, a built probe and a live process. None of
those can distinguish "the product renders" from "the process stayed alive", and the recorded failure mode is
concrete: on a runner with no interactive desktop the harness logged `SKIPPED_HEADLESS` and exited 0, so a
green tick meant "we did not check" -- the exact conflation the project forbids.

This probe answers the question the harness needs answered BEFORE it can trust any product readback:
*is this environment capable of drawing at all?* It never launches the product. Each layer returns its own
machine verdict, and the layers are the ones the plan names: interactive session, display, real drawing,
WebView2 runtime, loopback, and cleanup.

Verdict discipline (the whole point)
------------------------------------
`PASS` is returned by this script only when every REQUIRED layer passes. `NOT_AVAILABLE`, `NOT_RUN` and
`SKIPPED` are reported as themselves and can never add up to a pass -- the layer that could not be probed is
printed by name, and the summary verdict stays `INCOMPLETE`. A probe that cannot run is information; a probe
that cannot run and reports success is a lie.
