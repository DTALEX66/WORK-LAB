"""AG-19: test the owner's material root against the atlas pins for the missing originals.

Round C proved the timeline original absent by size and digest over the project tree, git objects and
60 archives — all inside this repository. Row AG-19b had only enumerated `D:\\All projects\\Record` BY
FILENAME, and that root is 15 GB / 114 files / 39 archives of multi-project material which no pin
test had covered. This is that coverage, and it is the stronger test: an exact-copy recovery must
match the pinned byte count (identical bytes imply identical size), so every file in scope is size-
filtered first and hashed only when its size equals a pin, and every archive is read by its central
directory so 31,382 members are compared without inflating them.

Two of the five atlas items (the 2026-09-28 startup prompt and the final execution document) carry no
`expected_sha256` at all. For those a hash-level negative proof is IMPOSSIBLE by construction: the
record labels them unpinned and the verdict cannot claim more than "no exact name hit attributed to
WORK-LAB". Naming that limit is the point of the instrument, not a caveat to smooth over.

CI-stability: the pin list is read from the promoted copy under `docs/history/archive/recovered-originals`
first, so a fresh runner has the real pins instead of a published echo of them (the atlas under
`.project-local` is only the fallback, and it is not on a runner). The Record root is not on a runner
either, so a run without it present reports `SCOPE_NOT_AVAILABLE_ON_THIS_MACHINE` and makes no absence
claim about the originals. Reads are read-only outside the Git root; the only writes are the tracked
record and the ignored detail file.

Usage: python scripts/audit/ag19_record_root_pin_test.py [--json-out PATH]
Exit: 0 measured (recovered or negatively proven in scope); 1 a recovery was found and needs landing;
      2 the pin source was unreadable.
