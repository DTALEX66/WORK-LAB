"""For the PASS records whose named check is gone: is it moved, or is the PASS claim unsupported?

A record whose regression command points at a file that no longer exists cannot be re-verified by that
command. Two very different states look identical in the ledger: the guard was re-pointed (so the claim
still has a home), and the guard was removed (so the PASS is now a claim with no check). This separates
them by basename, by history, and by the same symbol's presence under another path.
