"""Regenerate the full tracked-instrument inventory under scripts/audit and scripts/maintenance.

`docs/audits/PROBE_TOOL_PROMOTION_2026-10-07.json` was a promotion event record — 22 entries, each a
scratch original that became a tracked tool. It was never meant to describe the tree, and by the end of
round H the tree held 30 such files while the record listed 22: an inventory that only grows in prose
is the kind of record that misleads the next session into re-inventing a tool that already exists.

This produces the authoritative, complete inventory instead: path, sha256, bytes, lines, plus two
signals that say whether anything actually depends on the file —

  citedByLedgerPromises  tracked error-ledger `lifecycle.regressionCommand` strings naming it
  citedByRecords         any other tracked file (docs, audits, handoffs, registries) naming it

Usage: python scripts/audit/tool_inventory_readback.py [--out docs/audits/TOOL_INVENTORY_2026-10-07.json]

Ordering rule, learned the expensive way (ERR-151): this tool discovers instruments from the git
INDEX, so a newly added script is invisible to it until `git add` has run. Re-measure the inventory
AFTER staging and BEFORE committing — the 2026-10-07 head 1b2a747 was red on the runner for exactly
this reason (`tracked instruments absent from the inventory: ['scripts/audit/executor_live_probe.py']`)
while passing locally, because the committed inventory had been computed a moment earlier against a
file that was still untracked.
