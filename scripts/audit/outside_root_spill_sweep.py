"""Sweep the places this project's tools can leave bytes outside the Git root, and test attribution.

`.project/governance/project-data-boundary.json` says every project artifact stays inside the Git root
and that any write outside it is a spill that must be traceable, locatable, cleanable and migratable,
recorded one JSONL line per write in `.project-local/artifacts/spill-ledger.jsonl`. That is a
declaration; this is the measurement against it, in two independent directions:

  attribution — does anything outside the Git root carry a WORK-LAB-attributable name? Probed at the
                four declared shared roots, the tool caches the sanctioned runners would touch
                (uv interpreter installs, uv/pip caches, cargo registry, HF and modelscope caches,
                ollama blobs), `%TEMP%`, and the sibling project directories. A name hit is a spill to
                explain; a miss is a negative proven by enumeration, scoped to exactly the places a
                Python/Node/Rust tool on this machine writes.
  ledger      — does each recorded line satisfy the declared rule (timestamp, actor, action, source,
                target, the four spill properties), and is each `outOfRoot: true` target outside the
                Git root as claimed?

The tracked summary carries labels, counts and digests of path sets — never machine-local absolute
paths, which stay in the ignored detail report per the boundary declaration. Read-only: it writes no
file outside the Git root and never follows links or junctions.

Usage: python scripts/audit/outside_root_spill_sweep.py [--json-out PATH]
Exit: 0 when no spill-attributable finding and no ledger violation; 1 otherwise; 2 on a scan error.
