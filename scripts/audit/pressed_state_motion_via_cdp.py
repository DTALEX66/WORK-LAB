"""Prove the pressed state paints a different transform, over the shipped bundle, with real CSS state.

CL-16's first step is one dimension: `:active`. The two tokens that name it (`--motion-pressed`,
`--pressed-scale`) were declared in `apps/observer/frontend/src/index.css` and consumed by nothing -- the
only pressed rule in the tree was `.node:active{cursor:grabbing}` in `apps/observer/frontend/src/skins/b10.css`,
a cursor and not a motion -- so a token could be renamed, retuned or deleted and no check would notice,
which is the failure mode this project has already recorded as "aspirational tokens".

A synthetic `dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('mousedown'))` cannot light a CSS pseudo-class -- that is why the
four hover assertions in `scripts/audit/hud_strip_geometry_via_cdp.py` can never fail (recorded in the open
register, CL-17). So this instrument does not synthesise anything: it asks Chrome, over the CSS domain, to
force `:active` on a real node and then reads back `getComputedStyle`. The rule either reaches the painted
box or it does not.

Two surfaces, each read twice in its own browser process -- never two reads of one page:

  console  `…`                     the professional shell: `.nav button`, `.primary-btn`, `.ghost-btn`
  daily    `…&surface=daily`       the shell the desktop window shows: `nav[data-landmark="rail"] button`

  idle     no pseudo state forced  -- what the control looks like untouched
  pressed  `:active` forced        -- what the operator gets while the button is still down

Keeping idle and pressed in separate processes is what makes "the delta is real" checkable: a page that
reported the same transform twice would be a broken readback, and a page that reported a pressed transform
identical to idle means the rule was never applied. Measuring the daily surface separately is what keeps the
gate honest about coverage -- the first version of this instrument printed `controls=2` while the surface an
operator actually points at was matched by none of its selectors.

The expectation is DERIVED from the token, not pinned: `--pressed-scale` becomes the matrix diagonal the
browser must show, `--motion-pressed` becomes the `transition-duration` it must show. Retuning a token in
source therefore moves the floor with it instead of breaking a hardcoded number.
