"""Make the error ledger's promised regression proof re-runnable, or say plainly why it is not.

Every record in `taskpacks/current/error-ledger.json` promises a `regression_test` command. The
repository then moved twice — the 2026-09 convergence (`10-workflow/workflow-assistance` ->
`packages/client-neutral-core`, `services/`, `apps/observer`) and the `.hermes/task-runtime` ->
`.project-local` root move — so a record saying "this command is the proof" can name bytes that no
longer exist under that name. That is how a PASS record stops being verifiable while still reading
like one, and it is why 99 of them sat unbound.

Measured here: some operands resolve, some are the same basename at exactly one other tracked path,
some name nothing tracked at all, and some deliberately read a managed client's home (`Hermes
config.yaml`, `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`) which no checkout can contain. The tool does two things:

  * re-points the unambiguous moves, with anchored substitution so a path is replaced only when the
    whole token matches — the prefix-doubling class ERR-135 records;
  * stamps every record with `regressionTestVerifiability`, one of six labelled states, so a reader and
    a gate can tell "this proof re-runs here" from "this proof cannot re-run, and here is why".

Labels are stamped from the bytes that were actually written, never from the substitution that was
intended: a re-point that matched nothing must not be reported as one that happened. `status_after` is
never rewritten — an unverifiable promise is labelled, not silently downgraded and not silently
trusted. Everything read is tracked state (`git ls-files` plus the ledger), so the verdict cannot move
with local disk state, which is the lesson of ERR-142.

Usage:
    python scripts/audit/ledger_regression_command_targets.py            # measure only
    python scripts/audit/ledger_regression_command_targets.py --apply    # rewrite ledger + audit
Exit: 0 when every record carries a label and no ambiguity is left unadjudicated; 1 otherwise; 2 when
      the ledger cannot be parsed.
