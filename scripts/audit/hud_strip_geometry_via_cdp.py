"""HUD narrow-strip geometry gate — measure the declared 150x480 strip in a real browser, PASS or FAIL.

The strip's shape checks were written as `.project-local/runs/cl10/hud_narrow_probe.py`, in the
project's designated evidence area. That probe found real defects — a CJK label shattered one character
per line at 150px, and the hover state pushed the pinned footer to y=874 inside a 480px window — and it
went green again after each fix. Nothing in CI re-runs it, so the next commit may re-break either shape
silently. This file moves the load-bearing judgements into tracked, executed code.

Division of labour, the same as the topbar and legibility gates:
  * the browser harvests RAW facts only — boxes, per-line box widths, font sizes, painted strings;
  * `verdict()` holds every threshold and every judgement, so it is unit-testable without a browser and
    falsifiable with a planted fault (see `tests/ci/test_hud_strip_geometry_gate.py`). The evidence probe
    decided "this label is shattered" inside its own JS, and a judgement made in JS cannot be tested at
    all — that is the whole difference between an instrument and a gate.

What it does not judge: the 12px type floor and the AA contrast ratio. Both standards are owned by
`scripts/audit/text_legibility_via_cdp.py`, which since 2026-10-25 sweeps these same three shell surfaces
through `--shell-surfaces`. This file used to assert the floor itself; two gates reading one rule means two
exception lists and two thresholds to keep in step, which is how standards rot, so the duplicate is gone and
geometry is the single thing claimed here.

What it measures against: the built `dist`, served from ONE loopback origin that also answers
`GET /api/v1/snapshot` with the declared fixture below. A fixture is deliberate, not a shortcut: the
strip's geometry depends on how many tool rows the snapshot carries, so a gate bound to today's live
ledger reds when the data changes and greens when the layout breaks. The live-data desktop readback
stays where it belongs (real sidecar, real window); this gate answers one question — does the strip hold
its declared shape at a declared data shape — and says in every receipt which data shape that was.

Exit: 0 HUD_STRIP_GATE_PASS, 1 HUD_STRIP_GATE_FAIL, 2 bad input, 3 HUD_STRIP_GATE_NOT_RUN.
