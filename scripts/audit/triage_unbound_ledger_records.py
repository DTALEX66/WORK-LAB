"""Read-only triage of the ledger's unbound PASS records.

Records that claim PASS but carry no fixedCommit leave nothing pinning which change made them true. This
partitions them by what is checkable today: whether the record's own regression command points at a file
that exists, and when that file entered the tree relative to the record's date. The count is printed by the
run, never written here, because a number in this docstring goes stale the moment a row is appended.

Run AFTER `ledger_regression_command_targets.py`. This reads that audit's labels as the authority for where a
record's operand lives; regenerating this file against a stale targets audit writes states that
`test_ledger_unbound_triage.py` then contradicts (measured 2026-10-10: 'RESOLVES' vs 'NOT_IN_TARGETS_AUDIT').

It binds nothing. A fix commit is only honest when the record points at it; where the guard file predates
the record by many commits the candidate is ambiguous and must be decided per record, not in a batch — that
is the ERR-16 failure mode (a binder generating plausible provenance faster than a gate can reject it).
