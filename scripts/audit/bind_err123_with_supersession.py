"""Bind ERR-123 to the commit that actually fixed it, with the supersession stated in the same change.

Every predicate the binding gate will check is enforced here before anything is written: the commit exists,
it contains the record's own promised regression script, it touches a path the record names, and it is the
commit that recorded the error. The note also says what the gate cannot see - that the CSS mechanism this fix
introduced was deliberately removed later under an owner instruction, so the invariant moved to a different
guard rather than being silently deleted.
