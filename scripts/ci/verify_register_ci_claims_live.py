"""Ask GitHub what actually ran at every SHA the register's CI claims name, and publish that as tracked evidence.

The register asserts things like "exact-SHA CI not run", "green at 5037dd2", "red at f9f38d6". Those are
claims about an external system, so the offline consistency gate can only check them against the ledger's
`verifiedCommit` -- which records a verdict only where a record was bound there. A green claim at an older
head with no bound record is true and unverifiable-by-the-ledger at the same time, and the answer is not to
loosen the gate: it is to commit the measurement.

This tool writes `docs/audits/REGISTER_CI_CLAIMS_<date>.json`: for every pinned SHA named in a CI-shaped row
token, the check-runs GitHub reports (status, conclusion, name). The offline gate
`tests/workflow-assistance/test_register_ci_claims_agree_with_ledger.py` reads that file as the second
evidence source, so a claim can be backed either by a ledger `verifiedCommit` or by a published measurement,
and a claim that contradicts either one goes red.

It REFUSES (exit 2) when it cannot reach GitHub -- CI has no business calling the network, and a gate that
silently skips would let a stale claim pass as a verified one. The refusal is a named token, not an empty run.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/verify_register_ci_claims_live.py [--out docs/audits/REGISTER_CI_CLAIMS_YYYY-MM-DD.json]
Exit: 0 published; 1 a register claim contradicts what GitHub says; 2 refused (no network or no credentials).
