"""Run the root `tests/ci/` governance suite as a discovery-driven gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-10-01). The canonical gate ran 43 `tests/workflow-assistance/`
modules and **zero** of the 22 `tests/ci/` ones. That is a real blind spot, and it was
not hypothetical: while reconciling the independent audit I edited the shared
`taskpacks/current/error-ledger.json`, ran the canonical gate to green, pushed, and CI
failed on `scripts/ci/verify_error_ledger.py` — a verifier the local gate never
invoked. Two defects (an invalid `phase` enum value and the original-failure
`exit_code` being 0) were only found by CI. Running this module catches that whole
class locally, before a push.

DISCOVERY, NOT A LIST. The suite is globbed, so a new `tests/ci/test_*.py` is covered
the moment it lands instead of being silently skipped — the exact failure mode above.
Only a module this gate declares as POST_MERGE is excluded, and an exclusion must be
justified in EXCLUSIONS and have its reason asserted below, so the list cannot quietly
grow into "whatever was failing".

Read-only. Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure, 2 = discovery problem.
