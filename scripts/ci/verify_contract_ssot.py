"""U16: Cross-language contract SSOT conformance (catalog-driven, no hardcoded counts).

Single source of truth for cross-language contracts = the JSON Schema set,
referenced by .project/governance/contracts/contract-catalog.json.

This verifier is CATALOG-DRIVEN (P0-4.1: it never hardcodes a contract count,
so adding a contract cannot break the gate just because a number was frozen).

Hard-fail (exit 1) on real SSOT drift:
  1. catalog malformed (missing id/owner/schemaPath, duplicate ids)
  2. a catalog entry points to a schema that does NOT exist on disk
  3. the generated TS projection (packages/client-neutral-core/generated/contracts.ts)
     is missing, or its contract id set != the catalog id set (type drift)

ADVISORY (printed, does NOT fail the gate):
  A. on-disk .schema.json files under the canonical roots that are not in the
     catalog. These are surfaced so a reviewer can decide whether each is a
     cross-language authority (should be cataloged) or a helper schema (fine).
     Not every schema on disk is a cross-language contract authority, so this
     is a report, not a hard gate.

  CORRECTION (2026-10-08): "printed, does not fail" was itself the defect. A gate that can see an
  unexplained schema file and cannot go red is a gate whose output decays into decoration, and the
  count drifted silently (13 -> 12 as this session registered one of them). The set is still allowed
  to be unlisted, but every member must be DECLARED below with the reason measured from the tree, and
  the gate now fails both when a new unlisted schema appears and when a declared one disappears --
  so the boundary between "cross-language contract" and "python-side schema" stays a reviewed decision
  instead of an accident of whoever added a file last.
