"""Gate: may this commit be pushed? Only if a full-gate receipt names it and says GATE_EXIT=0.

Why this exists: the ordering rule (commit -> verify at HEAD -> push) has been broken three times,
twice by me. ERR-181 pushed a head whose own gate run had already reported red, because the wrapper's
exit code was read instead of the receipt. This one was pushed after a governance-only run. A receipt
that does not say which head it describes cannot answer "was THIS head verified", so
`run_quality_gate.py` now stamps `GATE_HEAD=<sha>` into its own output and this tool matches it.

Verdicts, each with a distinct exit code so a caller cannot mistake one for another:
  PUSH_PERMIT_OK            0   a receipt names this head and carries GATE_EXIT=0
  PUSH_PERMIT_REFUSE        1   NO_RECEIPT / RECEIPT_RED / NO_EXIT_LINE / NOT_A_COMMIT
  PUSH_PERMIT_NOT_RUN       3   the tool itself cannot work (no runs dir, git missing)
