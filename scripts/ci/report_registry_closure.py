"""AG-05 field-level closure report for the model / provider / runtime registries.

Authority: `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` > `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json`
> `AGENTS.md` + scoped machine contracts > this report.

Why this exists
---------------
The 2026-09-29 Master Atlas closed gap G05 with the acceptance wording
"逐字段闭合、完整hash、时间/来源、negative能力；不触碰实际模型" (close it *field
by field*, with complete hashes, time/source, negative capabilities, without
touching any actual model). The per-field repairs landed incrementally (AG-05,
AG-05b, AG-05c) and each is individually verified, but nothing answered the
aggregate question an auditor actually asks:

    across the three registries, which fields are CLOSED, which are
    EXPLICITLY OPEN (null with a stated reason), and which are still UNCLOSED?

A grep cannot answer that, and "no gate is red" cannot answer it either, because
an unclosed field is usually not a gate failure — it is a silent hole.

This script is read-only and answers that question as data, so the answer is
reviewable, diffable and testable rather than a matter of opinion. It never
matters as a pass/fail gate on "is the registry perfect": it reports closure and
exits 0 unless the registries are unreadable, because the honest current state
includes fields that are legitimately open.

Closure classes
---------------
CLOSED            a value is present and, where it is a reference, it resolves.
EXPLICITLY_OPEN   the value is null/absent AND a stated reason exists, so a
                  reader cannot mistake it for an oversight. This is the only
                  acceptable form of "missing".
UNCLOSED          null/absent with no reason, or a reference that does not
                  resolve. Every UNCLOSED entry is a real, named hole.

Output: `.project-local/runs/ag05-registry-closure.json` plus a one-line summary.
Exit codes: 0 report produced (whatever the closure state), 1 registries
unreadable, 2 environment error.
