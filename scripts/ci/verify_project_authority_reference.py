"""A03: machine authority-reference verifier for WORK-LAB.

Fail-closed, read-only check that the top-level authority package is present
and internally consistent. Run in CI (integration gate) and locally before
any execution task. It never mutates state; it only reports PASS/FAIL.

Checks (each failure aborts with a non-zero exit and a named reason):
- top human authority `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` exists and is normative;
- top machine authority `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json`
  exists, is valid JSON, and names exactly those two files;
- the scoped taskpack authority index
  `.project/governance/taskpack-authority-index.json` exists;
- the CURRENT taskpack file declared by the taskpack index exists on disk;
- the single live open-task register
  `taskpacks/current/OPEN-TASK-REGISTER.md` exists;
- exactly one taskpack is classified CURRENT in the taskpack index;
- every `operationalCompatibilityAllowlist` path declared by the project
  authority index exists on disk;
- P0-01: every tracked path the taskpack index references (the CURRENT
  taskpack file, `decisions[].path`, `decisions[].ledger`, and the tracked
  `staticHandoffViews[].entry_record`) exists on disk — `indexReferencesExist`
  is verified against the tree, never trusted from the stored value;
- P0-01: the taskpack supersedes graph is structurally valid — the
  classification buckets form a partition (no taskpack in two buckets) and
  the single CURRENT taskpack is not simultaneously marked retired/superseded;
- P0-03: subordinate current task cards — every `currentTaskCards[]` entry
  is a machine-checked planning record subordinate to the single CURRENT
  taskpack: the card path exists on disk; the card is referenced by the
  single OPEN register; the card never self-claims top-level authority; the
  card grants no more authority than its task grant (an explicit
  deferral / no-execution-authorization marker is required); a declared
  `registry_entry` binding resolves to a future-candidate-registry entry
  whose `task_card` points back to the card; and the card id is not
  classified in any taskpack bucket (a card is not a second taskpack);
- no forbidden legacy active root has been re-activated as a live module root.

Exit codes: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL (named reason printed), 2 environment error.
