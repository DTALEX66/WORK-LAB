"""Live documentation may not cite repository paths that do not exist.

Why this exists
---------------
Measured 2026-10-18: 383 stale `path` citations in tracked documents. Splitting them by *kind* is the whole
insight, and it changes the answer completely:

  * 376 sit in historical / audit documents (`docs/history/**`, `docs/audits/**`, `reports/**`,
    `knowledge-staging/**`, `taskpacks/history/**`). A record of what was true in September must keep naming
    the September path -- rewriting it would falsify the record. They are FROZEN, not broken.
  * 7 sat in live documents, and three of those were load-bearing: an authority document naming a binary path
    that no longer exists, a census naming a module without its extension, and a guide whose backticks made an
    external product's directory look like a repository path.

The recurring "old path" complaint was therefore never "the archive is dirty". It was: **live documents were
never checked**. The authority index resolves 51 targets; everything else was unverified, so a renamed file left
a citation behind that only a human reading that paragraph would ever notice.

Scope
-----
Live = root Markdown whose disposition is not `historical-non-normative` (the disposition registry decides that,
so demoting a document silences its citations in one place instead of two), plus `docs/current/`, `docs/decisions/`
and `docs/future/`. Frozen roots are named below, once, with the reason.

Exceptions must carry a reason and a date, and a stale exception (the path exists again) is itself a finding --
otherwise the exception list becomes the next place where old facts hide.
