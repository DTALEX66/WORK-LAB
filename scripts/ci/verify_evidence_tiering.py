"""Fail closed when an evidence bundle makes behavioural claims without a tier.

Audit F15/F16 exposed a class of defect rather than a single typo: an evidence
package can be *internally consistent* (every digest matches, every count adds
up) while still inviting a reader to conclude something the package cannot
support. The motivating examples were `external_roots_touched: []` and a secret
scan whose scanner source was not retained -- neither can establish that a root
was never accessed, only that the bundle says so.

The rule enforced here: if a bundle states a behavioural claim, it must carry an
explicit evidence tier, and a tier below VERIFIED must name what it cannot
establish. Tier meanings:

  DECLARED  the generating procedure asserted it; not independently reproduced
  OBSERVED  a named observation was recorded in the bundle
  VERIFIED  a third party can re-derive it from the bundle alone

This is a structural gate, not a text check: it inspects the structured fields a
bundle uses for behavioural claims, so silence can no longer pass as proof.

Read-only. Exit 0 = PASS, 1 = violation, 2 = usage/IO problem.
