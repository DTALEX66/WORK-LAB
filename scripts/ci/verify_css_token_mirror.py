"""One CSS custom property must mean one value per theme, whichever sheet declares it.

Measured 2026-10-08 on the shipped sheets: `--radius-sm` is declared `4px` in `src/index.css` and `12px` in
`src/skins/b10.css`, both under `:root`. b10.css loads second (src/main.tsx imports index.css, then
skins/b10.css, then skins/l10b-shell.css), so every consumer of `--radius-sm` renders **12px**, while
`src/theme/tokens.ts`, its unit test, and DESIGN.md's machine-readable `rounded:` block all state 4px, and the
contract test in tests/workflow-assistance/test_design_md_is_a_machine_readable_contract.py validates DESIGN.md
against index.css -- the one file whose value the browser ignores. A coherent contract can still describe
pixels that never happen.

The same shape decides `--shadow` and `--shadow-soft`, except there the two declarations are the same colour
written differently, which is formatting rather than drift -- so values are normalised before they are compared,
and a name that agrees after normalisation is not reported.
