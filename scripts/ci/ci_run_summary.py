"""W10 (2026-10-17): assemble a small, redacted run summary that a CI job uploads as an artifact.

Why this exists
---------------
Measured 2026-10-16: the repository produced **no artifacts at all** for any run. Auditing a red run therefore
started by opening a log URL and grepping a few thousand lines, and the three facts an auditor needs first --
which stage failed, with what exit code, and whether the run was ever planned -- were the hardest to find.
The plan stage computes a plan that only ever lived in `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and the gate writes its per-stage
record to a file nobody uploads.

What this is NOT
----------------
It is not a second verdict. `GATE_EXIT` and the aggregate job remain the only authorities; this file exists to
be read. In particular **a missing input is never rendered as success**: every absent input becomes an explicit
`{"status": "MISSING"}` plus a top-level `incomplete` list, because "no JSON" defaulting to "passed" is exactly
the failure the plan named.

Redaction stance
----------------
Fields are **whitelisted**, not scrubbed: the summary carries identity (repo/sha/tree/ref/event/job), step
names and statuses, the plan's own enumerated keys, and the gate record's enumerated keys. No free text from
logs, no environment dump, no command lines -- so there is nothing for a scrubber to miss.
