"""W09 (2026-10-17): a client's support level may not promise more than its evidence proves.

Why
---
`config/adapter-registry.json` already distinguishes `deep` / `experimental` / `manifest-only`, records
`operations`, `detection.mode`, `provenance.source_kind`/`version` and a `policy_projection` of
`*_supported` flags. Every one of those statements is true today by inspection -- and nothing enforced them.
The failure mode W09 names is exactly the quiet promotion: a client that is merely *installed*, or merely
*has a manifest*, being recorded as an integration, so that a later reader plans against capabilities that
were never verified. Nothing in the tree would have said so.

What it enforces (each rule is true of the registry as it stands; each catches a named promotion)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. `support_level == "manifest-only"`  -> no write operation and no apply/readback/rollback flag.
   A manifest is not an interface. (`workbuddy`, `cursor`, `claude-code` are the live cases.)
B. `detection.mode == "static"`        -> `apply_supported` false.
   Static detection cannot prove a live write interface exists.
C. `apply_supported` true              -> the reviewed adapter exists as `integrations/executors/<id>/` in the
   repository AND the provenance version is not UNVERIFIED. A write claim needs both.
   (`hermes`, `codex` are the live cases; `github` claims only `plan_supported`, so it needs neither.)
D. `provenance.version == "UNVERIFIED"` -> `support_level` is `manifest-only`.
   An unverified version may not be promoted above the tier that says "we have only seen a manifest".

Deliberately NOT enforced: how many clients exist, which ones are managed, and whether `qoder` should be
registered at all. Those are owner decisions (`Qoder/WorkBuddy 先 native-only/observe`); this checker only
refuses to let a *recorded* claim outrun its evidence.
