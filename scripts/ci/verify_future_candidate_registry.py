future_candidate_registry validator (GOAL 31 / P2-06).

Machine-SSOT check for the deferred-candidate registry
`.project/governance/future-candidate-registry.json`.

Design (fail-open, like verify_contract_ssot.py):
- Validates every entry against `contracts/future-candidate-registry.schema.json`.
- Enforces the invariants a registry consumer relies on:
    * every candidate status is a known enum value;
    * every candidate has default_enabled == False unless status is PROMOTED
      (a PROMOTED candidate must have promotion evidence in the task register);
    * ids are unique and match ^FUT-\\d{3}$;
    * every candidate names a `blueprint_row` that exists in the landed §16 table,
      and every landed §16 row has at least one candidate (pool coverage);
    * the registry declares no execution authority (governance.production_authorized
      must stay false) so a registry row can never be mistaken for a pilot grant.
  and, since the 2026-10-07 decision pass, the ones that keep a row honest about
  what it knows:
    * a decision (PROMOTE / KEEP_CANDIDATE / REJECT) agreeing with the status word,
      with a reason for a retirement and a blocker for a kept row;
    * an identity verdict — RESOLVED rows carry the org/repo and the licence the
      readback actually returned, AMBIGUOUS and NOT_FOUND rows may not claim one;
    * every `native_evidence` path exists on disk, so "already covered natively"
      and "this is a pilot" are claims about code rather than adjectives;
    * no placeholder text in a trigger, criterion or overlap field.
- Schema-conformance failures are ADVISORY (exit 0 with warnings) so a new field
  in the registry never silently breaks the gate; structural integrity failures
  (duplicate ids, PROMOTED without authorization, non-boolean default_enabled)
  are HARD and fail the gate.

Exit codes: 0 = pass (or advisory warnings only); 1 = hard integrity violation.
