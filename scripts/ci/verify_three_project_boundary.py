"""Three-project boundary verifier (WORK-LAB V2, fail-closed).

Machine check for the control-plane / knowledge / design ownership split:
    .project/governance/three-project-boundary.json  (SSOT)
    .project/governance/boundary-migration-manifest.json  (what moves, where)

The verifier fails closed when ANY of the following is missing:
  1. the boundary SSOT contract,
  2. a BOUNDARY.md marker in every split dir that is marked,
  3. a seam (integrations/archeaxis/contracts/*) for every split that declares one,
  4. a migration manifest entry covering every split.

No file moves, no code deletion — this only PROVES the boundary is marked and
gated. Running it is the audit trail that the three-project split is real,
not a doc promise.

Exit 0 = boundary marked+gated; exit 1 = fail-closed (boundary gap).
