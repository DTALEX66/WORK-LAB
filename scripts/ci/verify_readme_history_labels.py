"""Fail when the workflow README points a reader at a frozen record without saying it is frozen.

`docs/current/workflow-assistance/workflow/active-authority-index.md` states the rule; until now nothing
checked it, and the README carried 14 links into history roots while its tests only asserted that a couple
of strings appear somewhere. Most of those links are honest provenance inside an index of archived
documents. One was not: the upgrade-recovery runbook introduced an archived 2026-08-13 handoff with
"today's ... recovery procedure is at ...", which is exactly how a frozen record gets followed as current
guidance.

The decidable form: a line linking into `docs/history/` or `taskpacks/history/` must be labelled as past
either in its own prose or by the heading it sits under (an archive index is legitimate; a runbook
delegating today's procedure is not).

Worth keeping the reason the first version was wrong: it searched the raw line for words like `archive`,
and every one of these paths contains `history/archive/` -- so the link matched its own URL and the gate
passed on 14 of 14 links, including the violation it exists to catch. Link targets and inline code are
therefore stripped before any word is looked for.
