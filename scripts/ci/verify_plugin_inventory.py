"""Refuse a plugin record that claims more traceability than it has.

Audit F07 exposed two failure modes in `config/plugin-inventory.json`:

1. A plugin could record `commit: null, hash: null` while the live install
   metadata DID declare a revision, so the record was less informative than the
   machine it described.
2. Worse, a revision STRING was treated as sufficient. It is not: the audit's own
   caveat is that a revision cannot prove the installed bytes match that commit.
   Verified live on chrome-profiles - the declared revision is correct
   (`git rev-parse HEAD` equals it) yet the working tree does NOT match, because
   `__init__.py` is locally modified (24,433 B installed vs 23,764 B committed).

This gate enforces the distinction the record must keep: a DECLARED lifecycle and
an OBSERVED installation are different facts, and a plugin with a floating
revision must not be presented as if it were pinned to verified bytes.

Rule set (fail-closed):
  - an entry whose lifecycle is `installed`/`enabled`/`active` must carry an
    `observed` block, because a claim of presence must be dated and evidenced;
  - an `observed` block must state whether the working tree matches the commit,
    and when it does not it must name the modified paths, so a local delta can
    never be silently dropped;
  - `pinned: false` (a floating revision) is only acceptable when the record says
    which revision was actually observed;
  - a declared-vs-observed disagreement must be recorded explicitly rather than
    being resolved by editing the declared value.

Read-only. Exit 0 = PASS, 1 = violation, 2 = usage/IO problem.
