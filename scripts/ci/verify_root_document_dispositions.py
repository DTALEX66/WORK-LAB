"""Verify that every Markdown document at the repository root declares its disposition.

The hazard this closes: a root file whose name reads like an assignment
(`HANDOFF-*.md`, `*_REPORT.md`, `*_MANIFEST.md`) is opened by a new session before the
authority chain is, and it can command work that the CURRENT taskpack already closed.
Six such documents exist. None of them may be *deleted* (WUI-17 acceptance: preserve the
original bytes/hashes, and `UI_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` is load-bearing as the uppercase
falsifier in `tests/workflow-assistance/test_path_text_is_one_predicate.py:83`), so the
control is: label each one at the top, and keep the label honest by machine.

Verdicts, all red, never a silent skip:
  ROOT_DISPOSITIONS_PASS        every tracked root document is classified and labelled
  ROOT_DISPOSITIONS_FAIL        named findings (unclassified / stale row / no marker /
                                pointer not current / body bytes changed / bad vocabulary)
  ROOT_DISPOSITIONS_NO_GIT      the tracked-file population could not be enumerated
