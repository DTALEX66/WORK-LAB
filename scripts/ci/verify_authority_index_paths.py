"""Every path-shaped reference in a navigation surface must resolve in the TRACKED tree, or be declared.

Two deliberate choices, both learned the hard way in this repo.

Resolution is against `git ls-files`, never against the filesystem. An ignored directory such as
`.project-local/` exists on the machine that wrote the sentence and does not exist on a fresh checkout, so
a filesystem test makes the verdict host-dependent -- the same class of defect as an authorization decision
computed with `Path.resolve()`. A directory reference counts as real when at least one tracked file sits
under it.

Why this exists: the authority index is the navigation surface for the whole chain and nothing checked it.
Measured on 2026-10-08 before the fix, section 3 sent readers to `docs/handoffs/` and `docs/audit/`,
directories that have not existed since the 2026-09 convergence, and section 2 named the config standard
without the date suffix that both the file on disk and AGENTS.md carry.

`--index` may be repeated to judge named surfaces only. With no argument the scan is widened to every
tracked markdown file under `docs/current/`; the four navigation surfaces in NAVIGATION_SURFACES are
held to a stricter rule (a navigation surface that yields no references is a broken checker, while an
ordinary prose page that makes no tree claim is allowed and counted in `no_tree_claims`), and the whole
run refuses to pass below a measured reference floor.
