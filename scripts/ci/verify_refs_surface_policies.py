"""Hold the three WUI-17 surfaces to the policy each one earned, instead of switching them on naively.

WUI-17 registered `REFS-RATCHET-HISTORY-SURFACES-20261009` after measuring 4,153 references across
`reports/`, `knowledge-staging/` and the repository root: 3,262 did not resolve against the tracked tree.
Switching that population into a "every reference must resolve" gate would have dumped 3,262 findings on
the next writer, so the decision was to split it by what each surface is FOR:

  1. external skill copies -- these sentences describe their own upstream repositories, not this tree,
     so the subtree is declared, per surface, as a non-repository navigation surface;
  2. date-stamped archives -- rewriting a dated record makes it describe a tree it never saw, so they
     are ratcheted: the count may not grow, and every baseline row must still be broken;
  3. "still being written" -- re-measured 2026-10-18 and reclassified on evidence: all of the 143 broken
     references in that bucket live in date-stamped reports (44), five NON-NORMATIVE-HISTORICAL root
     records (93) whose bodies are byte-frozen by `verify_root_document_dispositions.py`, or AGENTS.md's
     six `skills/`/`bin/` citations -- the sentence whose point is that those repository-root directories
     do not exist. None of them is a navigation claim about the current tree, so they are ratcheted with
     the same growth/shrinkage rule rather than edited.

The resolution rule is imported, not re-implemented: `scripts/ci/verify_authority_index_paths.py:check()`.
A gate that invented its own reader would drift from the live-surface gate and the two numbers would stop
being comparable.

Ratchet semantics, deliberately two-sided: a new broken reference fails (growth), and a baseline row that
resolves today fails too (drift) -- repairing a pointer is a real change and must reissue the baseline in
the same commit. A one-sided ceiling would let a repair silently shrink what the baseline records.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/verify_refs_surface_policies.py              # report
    python scripts/ci/verify_refs_surface_policies.py --write-baseline   # reissue after a measured change

Exit: 0 clean, 1 policy violation, 2 the scan itself could not run.
