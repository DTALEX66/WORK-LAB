"""AG-05: fail-closed integrity verifier for the model/provider/runtime registries.

Authority chain: `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` > `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json`
> `AGENTS.md` + scoped machine contracts > this verifier. This script never
mutates anything and never touches the network, a model asset, a runtime
process, or any global software configuration. It reads JSON only.

Why this exists
---------------
The 2026-09-29 Master Atlas recorded that the three registries disagreed with
each other (gap G05, card row AG-05): a provider bound to a model id that no
longer existed, provider entries that claimed `OPERATIONAL` while their own
notes said the weight was not served, digests that were truncated prose rather
than verifiable checksums, and in-process ASR libraries that were not
distinguishable from HTTP servers. Each is a silent-wrong-truth hazard: a
caller reading one field concludes a capability is callable when it is not.

Checks (every one fails closed with a named reason)
--------------------------------------------------
1  `binds_to_model` must resolve to a `models[].id`, or to an explicitly
   declared `externalAssets[].id` (a read-only reference the registry does not
   own), or be an explicit `null` with a non-empty `binding_note` explaining
   why there is no binding. A dangling foreign key is a failure.
2  `binds_to_runtime` must resolve to a `runtimes[].id` or a
   `processLibraries[].id`. In-process libraries are declared distinctly from
   HTTP servers via `executionModel`, so a process library is never mistaken
   for a service that can be polled.
3  `binding_status` is a closed vocabulary. A provider whose model entry is
   RETIRED_PENDING_DECISION must declare `UNSERVED_RETAINED_PENDING_DECISION`
   and must NOT declare `SERVED`. This is the contradiction check: an entry may
   not simultaneously be "not served" and "served".
4  `operationalStatus` is explicitly scoped to the runtime endpoint and may not
   use serving vocabulary ("loads this model", "serves this model") when the
   binding is not served. That phrasing is what made the old rows read as
   "this model works".
5  An `assetDigest` block is either absent, or has `state: COMPLETE` with a
   lowercase 64-hex `sha256`, or has `state: TRUNCATED` with a non-empty
   reason. A truncated prefix may never masquerade as a complete digest.
6  A provider id appears at most once; provider ids are namespaced.

Exit codes: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL (named reason printed), 2 environment error.
