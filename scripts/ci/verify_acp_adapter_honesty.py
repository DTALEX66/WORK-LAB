"""AG-06: fail-closed ACP adapter honesty matrix.

Authority chain: `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` > `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json`
> `AGENTS.md` + scoped machine contracts > this verifier.

Why this exists
---------------
The 2026-09-29 Master Atlas (gap G06, card row AG-06) found that the federation
surface could be read as "native execution works" when it does not. Concretely:
`acp_adapter.ExecutorAcpAdapter` implements NEW / RESUME / PROMPT / CANCEL / FORK
as degraded results (`NOT_IMPLEMENTED` / `NOT_SUPPORTED` / `NOT_LAUNCHABLE`),
and most concrete adapters do not override them. The Atlas also recorded that
`HermesAdapter.new` "calls the base class and is not implemented" — it overrides
`new` but delegates to `super().new()`, so the override changes nothing about
whether the operation executes.

A handler returning a result is NOT a completed execution (WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY
§10). This script therefore reports, per executor and per ACP operation, four
SEPARATE levels that must never be collapsed into one:

    declared          what the adapter advertises via `capabilities()`
    implemented       whether the concrete class actually overrides the method
    executable        whether the operation can produce a real effect today
    native_verified   whether a real native receipt exists for it

The honest answer for this repository today is that `declared` overstates
reality, and the matrix makes that visible instead of hiding it behind a green
capability list.

What is checked (fail-closed)
----------------------------
1  Every operation the federation advertises must be classified. An operation
   that is advertised but neither implemented nor explicitly declared
   unsupported is a failure (silent gap).
2  `native_verified` may never be claimed without a native receipt handle. A
   claimed verification with an empty handle is invalid (AUTHORITY §10).
3  An operation reported `executable: true` must not return a degraded status
   when probed. This is the real contradiction check: it is exactly what
   caught `HermesAdapter.new`.
4  Every registered executor must appear in the matrix and vice versa.

Probing is strictly read-only. `new()` is called with `project_id=""` and no
`out_dir`; the base implementation never spawns a process, and adapters whose
CLI is absent report NOT_LAUNCHABLE before any launch could occur. Nothing is
written, downloaded, installed or started.

Exit codes: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL (named reason printed), 2 environment error.
