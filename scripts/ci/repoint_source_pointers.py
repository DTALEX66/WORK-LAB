"""Repoint `path:LINE` citations to the line the quoted code actually lives on -- mechanically.

Why this exists
---------------
Four CI failures in two days came from the same cause, and the repairs kept failing because they were done by
hand: read the gate's message, guess the new line, push, watch it fail one line off. A pointer is a mechanical
fact, so re-deriving it must be mechanical.

The root cause has TWO shapes, and conflating them is why the fixes never held
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Code citations** -- `path:LINE <backtick-quoted code>`. The quote identifies the target, so the line can be
   re-derived exactly. These are repairable, and this tool repairs them.
2. **Narrative pointers** -- `path:LINE` in prose, with no quote. Nothing identifies what the number meant, so
   it cannot be verified and it rots silently the moment the file changes above it. No amount of re-measuring
   keeps these honest; the only durable fix is to stop citing a line number in prose (`--drop-narrative`).

What it does
------------
* for each code citation: locate the exact quoted line in the target file (closest occurrence to the old line
  when several match), report LANDED / DRIFT / UNRESOLVED, and with `--apply` rewrite it keeping range width;
* for each narrative pointer: report NARRATIVE, and with `--drop-narrative` replace `path:NNN` with `path` so the
  number stops claiming precision it does not have;
* it REFUSES rather than guesses: an unresolvable quote is reported and `--apply` exits non-zero.

Exit codes: 0 = every citation lands on its quote and no narrative pointer remains; 1 otherwise.
