"""No rule may exist only in CI: every check a workflow runs must be reachable from a local run, or be
declared with the reason it cannot be.

Why this exists, measured rather than asserted: `scripts/ci/verify_blueprint_coverage.py` ran in the
integration job and in no local gate, so the branch was red at two pushed heads while the canonical
local gate printed PASS on the same tree. The writer had no way to know, because the check they broke
was a check they could not run. That is a structural gap, not a one-off: anything a workflow invokes
and no local route reaches will eventually be broken by an honest edit.

Reachability is decided from repository text, never from a machine's state:
  NAMED_GATE   -- the runner lists it in a gate body (services/orchestration/run_quality_gate.py)
  TEST_ROUTE   -- some test module names it (the root batch and the workflow batch are discovered
                  dynamically, so a test wrapper counts as a local route)
  SELF_RUN     -- the operand is itself a discovered test module
  DECLARED     -- an infrastructure step with a stated reason, re-checked so a declaration cannot
                  quietly outlive its excuse
Exit 0 prints CI_CHECK_REACHABILITY_PASS; anything else names what a local writer cannot see.

# exercised by CI's receipt gates -- and that limit belongs in the record, not in a frozen exemption list.
