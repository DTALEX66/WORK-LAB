"""W07 (2026-10-17): prove the CI-job <-> local-gate mapping, in both directions.

Why
---
The profile says which local gate a change requires. The workflows say which jobs actually run -- and their
job IDs are what branch protection aggregates. Before this checker, the two sides agreed by *resemblance*:
the five heavy gates happened to share their IDs with the workflow jobs, and four additional required jobs
(`schema-fixtures`, `observer-readonly`, `config-compiler`, `capsule-verify`) were covered by nothing at all,
invisibly. A rename on either side, or a new job, would have changed what CI requires without changing what a
writer's local run suggests -- and nothing would have said so.

What it enforces
----------------
1. every profile gate names a `ci_job` that exists as a job ID in one of the workflows;
2. every job ID in either workflow is accounted for -- claimed by a gate, or declared `structural_jobs` (the
   plan/aggregate machinery), or declared under `additional_required_jobs` (a required job with no gate);
3. no stale declarations: every declared job exists, and a declared `local_route` names a tracked file;
4. `local_route: null` is ALLOWED and is the point -- it makes a CI-only check visible. Silence is what this
   rejects, not a gap.
5. (CL-14, 2026-10-25) every stage in the canonical gate's `VERIFY_ORDER` is either invoked by name in a
   workflow step or declared under `ci.stage_coverage` with a reason. This direction did not exist, so 27 of
   the 50 stages a writer's `verify` run performs were simply absent from the CI picture: nobody could tell
   "CI does not require this" from "CI requires it under another name" -- and a stage whose CI absence is
   unstated is a coverage claim, not a gap disclosure.
