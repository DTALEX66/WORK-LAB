"""Fail when a path that was archived on 2026-10-19 reappears on an active surface.

The hazard this closes is the one the owner named: after a normalization pass, an index or a
script still points at the old location, and a later session follows it onto material that was
deliberately taken off the visible surfaces. `scripts/ci/verify_authority_index_paths.py` only
sees `docs/current/` plus three named surfaces, so a stale pointer in `.project/governance/`,
`scripts/`, `tests/`, `apps/` or `docs/decisions/` would pass every existing gate.

Rules:
  * the population is the tracked file list minus the frozen/evidence prefixes named in the
    manifest -- an input set derived from the thing being enforced, not hand-listed;
  * frozen history and dated evidence are OUT OF SCOPE rather than edited: their old paths are
    the historical object of their own sentences;
  * a protected file that still carries old paths is a NAMED ALLOWANCE with a minimum count and
    a reason. An allowance that is no longer used fails, so fixing the file cannot leave a
    silent licence behind;
  * the scan refuses to report green on a suspiciously small population.

Verdicts, all red, never a silent skip:
  STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_PASS       every active surface is clean and each allowance is still used
  STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_FAIL       named stale references, unmet allowances, or unused allowances
  STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_NO_GIT     the tracked-file population could not be enumerated
  STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_NO_MANIFEST the move record is missing or unreadable
