# DeepSeek Harness (DSH) — agent-runtime adapter

DSH is an **agent runtime** adapted into WORK-LAB as a replaceable,
approval-gated executor. It runs bounded agent tasks in an isolated, task-scoped
Git worktree. It is **not** a WORK-LAB core module, not a model gateway, not a
Hermes replacement, and it never writes client config or completes a Task Ledger
task.

## Deployed identity (2026-09-02 verified)

The machine DSH switched from the 0.1.x source-checkout lineage to the **2.0.x
community desktop build** (see upgrade records in the DSH handoff + skill
`dsh-administration` references/dsh-2.0.4-upgrade.md):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | `anywhere-labs/dsh-desktop` community desktop (Electron shell + bundled full harness, `dsh-plugin-desktop`) |
| Version | **2.0.4** (verified 2026-08-30; 2.0.2 → 2.0.4 NSIS upgrade) |
| Single entry | `D:\All projects\DSH\DSH Desktop.exe` (D-drive; LOCALAPPDATA copy removed) |
| Config root | `C:\Users\<user>\.dsh\` (settings/profiles/sessions/memory/skin-center/task-board/storages) |
| Web | loopback `http://127.0.0.1:43120` (community build port; legacy 0.1.x used 3080) |
| Sessions | 94 UUID dirs preserved under `~/.dsh/sessions/<project>/<uuid>/` (4 project dirs) |
| Legacy 0.1.x | `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` pinned `47f94385` — retired; full body backed up under `.hermes/task-runtime/dsh-011-removed-20260824/` (rollback baseline, do not touch) |

The adapter module (`integrations/executors/dsh/deepseek_harness_adapter.py`)
reports `detect()`/`observe()` against this community-desktop identity; the
legacy `UPSTREAM_*` pin remains as the historical governance record of the
retired isolated-checkout contract.

## Contract invariants (taskpack §4.1)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `install_mode` | `community-desktop` (legacy contract: `isolated_source_checkout`) |
| `entrypoints` | `web` via desktop shell (single launcher: `DSH Desktop.exe`) |
| `network` | `loopback_only` — `127.0.0.1` (localhost / ::1), port `43120` default (community web); legacy 0.1.x `3080` |
| `workspace_scope` | `task_scoped_git_worktree_only` |
| `secrets` | `runtime_secret_only` — never in repo/receipt/Observer; `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` read by the app only |
| `execution_authority` | `execute_only_no_task_completion_authority` |
| `external_mutation` | `approval_required` |
| `plugin_policy` | `builtins_only` |
| `upgrade_policy` | `official_installer_upgrade + explicit_upgrade_task + compatibility_evidence` (community releases via NSIS installer; never manual pnpm in app-managed dirs) |
| `rollback` | stop app → preserve `~/.dsh` config → quarantine old version; restore = reinstall prior release + config preserved |

## Runtime data (git-ignored, never committed)

Community desktop keeps its own data under `~/.dsh` (outside the repo). The
legacy isolated-checkout layout `.project-local/runs/deepseek-harness/`
(`source/` + `dsh-home/`) is retained only as the historical/rollback surface of
the retired 0.1.x contract and must not be treated as live state.

## Start / stop / health (approval-gated)

These are **not** performed by the adapter by default; each is an approval item.

- **Launch**: start `D:\All projects\DSH\DSH Desktop.exe` (Electron loads
  `http://127.0.0.1:43120`; ~20-40 s boot). HTTP 403 on `/` is the app's route
  control — service is up, not a fault.
- **Stop**: quit the app process tree (no `taskkill /F` on unknown PIDs).
- **Health**: loopback readback on `127.0.0.1:43120` + process presence;
  version read from `resources/app.asar.unpacked/package.json` (no side
  effects). Never a screenshot as proof of binding.

## Configuration location (no values)

DSH config and credentials live under `~/.dsh` (settings.yaml, profiles,
`.credentials.yaml`, memory, skin-center, task-board). The model key is entered
by the user in the DSH UI; Hermes never reads, displays, or writes it, and only
verifies a redacted credential descriptor.

## Permissions

- Workspace must be a Git worktree under the project — never `D:\All projects`
  itself, never the user home, never a drive root.
- Default: no file-write / command / network permission outside the approved
  task; every external mutation is approval-required.

## Evidence (receipt)

A receivable receipt may only contain: `task_id`, `adapter_id`, `upstream_commit`,
start/end time, repo-relative workspace id, command kind, approval result, exit
code, test summary, file-change summary (path+hash), error kind, evidence hash.

Forbidden in any receipt: API keys, full prompts, full responses, source text,
raw session ids, private paths, provider-private headers, unredacted logs.

## Failure classes and rollback

- **Version/install drift** (expected version vs installed) → verify
  `app.asar.unpacked/package.json`; reinstall the official release on mismatch.
- **Non-loopback listener** → stop and report immediately.
- **Web won't boot after app launch** → app is alive but `:43120` not listening:
  check `~/.dsh` integrity (task-board ledger lock etc. — see skill
  `dsh-administration` pitfalls) before any reinstall.
- **Secret in dump/receipt** → fail closed, redact, do not serialize.

Rollback: stop the app, keep `~/.dsh` config untouched, reinstall the previous
official release; never destructive reset/clean.

## Upgrade

Any upstream upgrade is a separate `WL-DSH-UPGRADE-*`: release notes review →
config-backup (`~/.dsh` excluded node_modules) → stop app → official installer
→ verify version + sessions preserved → schema/adapter compatibility. Follow
the skill `dsh-administration` reference `dsh-2.0.4-upgrade.md` for the
validated NSIS path.
