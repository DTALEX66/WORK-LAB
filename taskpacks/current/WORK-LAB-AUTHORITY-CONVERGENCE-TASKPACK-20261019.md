# WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY-CONVERGENCE-TASKPACK-20261019

**Status:** CURRENT / MINIMAL_LOOP_DELIVERED (authority convergence + first real loop delivered; other tasks remain frozen)
**Date:** 2026-10-19
**Owner:** DTALEX66
**Authority source:** user directive 2026-10-19 + `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` + `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json`
**Source package:** `docs/history/owner-inputs/20261019/WORK-LAB_权威收敛任务包_20261019.zip` (`WL-REC-0105`)
**Product implementation:** DELIVERED under the 2026-10-19 user grant (“执行所有未完成的任务，按照最新发你的任务包”):
one product fix for `WORK-LAB-MINIMAL-LOOP-001` (`services/execution-federation/hermes_adapter.py`),
verified at the adapter layer and recorded as `SOLUTION-001`. No other product feature is implemented;
documentation update alone is still not feature completion.

## 1. Purpose

The owner directive of 2026-10-19 freezes other tasks and makes this package the current
authority and closed-loop target: verify the current authority/index/ledger/Git state,
converge the formal positioning and roadmap, and establish one real minimal problem loop
as the first current work item. It is not a new Agent, not a rewrite of WORK-LAB, and not
implementation of historical proposals.

The formal positioning is the one recorded in `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` §2:
WORK-LAB is a client-neutral, personal-AI-environment workflow management, governance,
runtime monitoring and problem closed-loop system. It is not an Agent, a generic Agent
Runtime, a model gateway, a generic chat client, or a universal professional auditor.

## 2. Baseline recorded before any edit

| HEAD vs `origin/main` | 1 commit ahead (`0369d349` is a descendant of `f6077d18`) |
| Worktree | 59 porcelain entries before this task; 4 are the protected parallel-writer files (`AGENTS.md`, `config/adapter-registry.json`, `config/client-evidence.json`, `taskpacks/current/error-ledger.json`) |
| Top human authority | `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` |
| Top machine authority | `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json` |
| Scoped taskpack authority | `.project/governance/taskpack-authority-index.json` |
| Single open-task register | `taskpacks/current/OPEN-TASK-REGISTER.md` |

The dirty worktree contains prior WUI/HUD work. This task does not revert, overwrite or
commit it. Only the files listed in §7 and the new files created for this convergence are
edited.

## 3. Scope

Allowed:

- Authority and roadmap convergence: `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md`, the two governance indexes,
  the new CURRENT taskpack, the convergence report/roadmap, and the index/handoff surfaces
  that would otherwise misdirect the next reader to the superseded UI-first current.
- Registration of this owner package in the existing owner-material catalog.
- Read-only inspection of the repository to build the conflict matrix and capability map.

Not allowed:

- Product feature implementation, Agent/Runtime framework work, model gateway work, or
  rewriting historical proposals into code. **Amended 2026-10-19:** the user directive
  “执行所有未完成的任务，按照最新发你的任务包” is the concrete Task Grant for the minimal
  loop only (one product fix, ML-001); it does not authorize any other feature work.
- Modifying `DESIGN-LAB` or `AAOS` repositories, or writing their internal state.
- Overwriting the dirty worktree; reverting or committing protected parallel-writer files.
- Creating a second task truth, a second open register, or closing tasks without evidence.
- Claiming tests, live runtime verification, solution solidification or AAOS acceptance that
  did not happen.

## 4. Problem loop and first real minimal loop

The tracked problem loop is:

`发现 → 去重/关联 → 问题摘要 → 匹配历史方案 → 建议或 Agent 修复任务包 → 用户/授权策略交接 → Agent 实际修复 → 测试与运行读回 → 关闭或继续 → 方案固化 → 必要时 AAOS 知识候选`

The stages are recorded separately. Agent self-report, HTTP 200, a single exit code, a
document edit or a submitted candidate is never by itself a verified repair or an AAOS
acceptance.

The first real minimal loop was delivered on 2026-10-19 under the user grant.
`WORK-LAB-MINIMAL-LOOP-001` started from a real, reproducible, locally observable problem
(the tracked AG-06 capability verifier failing on the live tree), produced an issue summary
and a manual repair handback (no live handoff interface exists), was repaired in the product
(`services/execution-federation/hermes_adapter.py`), verified by re-running the exact gate,
12+49 regression tests and an adapter-level readback, and recorded as
`docs/current/authority-convergence-20261019/solutions/SOLUTION-001-ACP-HERMES-RESUME.md`.
No simulated data stood in for the real source. Details and receipts:
`docs/current/authority-convergence-20261019/implementation/WORK-LAB-MINIMAL-LOOP-001-ACP-HERMES-RESUME.md`.

## 5. Deliverables and acceptance

| Deliverable | Where | State after this task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository baseline | this file §2 + convergence report | RECORDED |
| Positioning conflict matrix | `docs/current/authority-convergence-20261019/AUTHORITY-CONVERGENCE-20261019.md` | DELIVERED |
| Updated formal authority | `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md` | DELIVERED (documentation) |
| Updated machine authority | `.project/governance/project-authority-index.json`, `.project/governance/taskpack-authority-index.json` | DELIVERED (documentation) |
| Converged roadmap | `docs/current/authority-convergence-20261019/ROADMAP.md` | DELIVERED |
| Current capability map | convergence report §capability map | DELIVERED with measured evidence and gaps |
| Future capability list | roadmap CURRENT/NEXT/FROZEN/DEFERRED/RETIRED + unfreeze conditions | DELIVERED |
| Test report | convergence report §test report | DELIVERED with commands, exit codes, exact HEAD |
| Source package registration | `docs/history/owner-inputs/RECORD-ARCHIVE-REGISTER.json` (`WL-REC-0105`) + member register | DELIVERED |
| One real minimal loop | `WORK-LAB-MINIMAL-LOOP-001` + `SOLUTION-001` | DELIVERED (implementation card; verifier + 12/49 tests + adapter readback; AAOS NOT_SUBMITTED; CI not run) |

Acceptance follows the owner package: positioning is workflow management/governance/
runtime monitoring/problem closed loop; the non-goals are explicit; the loop and its
separate states are recorded; UNKNOWN/STALE are honest; Observer is read-only and writes
only through separately authorized Control; AAOS keeps formal knowledge review and
acceptance; cross-project memory/session federation/autonomous Agent collaboration are
frozen or deferred; no parallel ledger; no dirty work overwritten; no test or feature
overclaim.

## 6. Freeze of other tasks

| Scope | State | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WUI-00..WUI-21 and all rows in the open register other than this convergence task | FROZEN_20261019 | No dispatch, no status rewrite, no evidence-free closure. Recorded statuses stay as they were. |
| Prior UI taskpack `WORK-LAB-UI-PRIORITY-TASKPACK-20261009` | SUPERSEDED_20261019 / FROZEN | Kept for history; no longer CURRENT. |
| Historical taskpacks, handoffs and blueprints | FROZEN_HISTORY | Non-normative; do not reopen by name alone. |
| Future capabilities in the roadmap | FROZEN or DEFERRED per roadmap | Unfreeze only through the roadmap gate and a new explicit user decision. |
| Product implementation of the minimal loop | DELIVERED (2026-10-19 user grant) | ML-001 one-file product fix; no further product work is authorized by this taskpack. |

## 8. Verification

Executed commands, exit codes and the exact HEAD are recorded in the convergence report
§test report. Raw outputs and the machine receipt index are under
`.project-local/artifacts/authority-convergence-20261019/`; they are worktree gate receipts,
not exact-SHA CI. The 14 worktree gates pass (14/14); the report also records ten additional
read-only consumer checks. Of those, only one is red for a reason outside this task (drift in
the external source-inventory snapshot); the pre-existing ACP capability declaration mismatch
was fixed by ML-001 and its verifier now passes. The report states which items were not
executed and why.

## 9. Rollback

Revert only this task's files to the pre-task bytes; do not use destructive repository-wide
reset/clean. The prior UI taskpack and all historical records remain in place, so restoring
them as current is a matter of reverting the authority/index pointers and the freeze
banners. The new owner-material archive and register rows are additive and can be removed
as a unit if the archival decision is withdrawn.

## 10. Next step

The minimal loop in §4 is delivered (ML-001 / SOLUTION-001). Remaining steps require owner action:
confirm the result, then authorize commit/push so exact-SHA CI can judge the product change.
Any further loop or system capability needs a new explicit user Task Grant; until then all other
work stays frozen and this taskpack remains the only current plan.

## 11. Amendment 2026-10-19 — archive normalization (user directive)

**Directive (verbatim):** “任何旧的过时的冗余的陈旧的，不要再明面上，全部归档到该去汇总的地方，
包括仓库目录文件夹整体搬走，要么压缩归档到历史里。我描述不准确，按照规范化处理，防止再次索引路径到旧资料上”。

This is an amendment to this CURRENT taskpack, not a second task truth: no register row is
closed, reopened or rewritten in status, and no other work is unfrozen.

**Normalization target (existing conventions):** documents under `docs/history/archive/`,
taskpacks under `taskpacks/history/`, evidence under `reports/` and `docs/audits/`, external
copies under `knowledge-staging/`. Moves are `git mv`; nothing is deleted and no historical
body is rewritten.

**Executed moves — 54 items**, all recorded with `from`/`to`/`sha256`/`bytes`/`lastCommit` in
`docs/history/archive/MOVED-PATHS-20261019.json`:

| Group | Count | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root UI records (six `.md` + `design.qa.yaml`) | 7 | `docs/history/archive/root-ui-records-20261019/` |
| Frozen UI round directory (formerly under `docs/current/`, named ui-priority-20261009; backticks in this repo mean "resolvable path", so the old name is written bare) | 20 | `docs/history/archive/ui-priority-20261009/**` |
| Non-current `taskpacks/current/**` (all but register, README, error ledger, this taskpack) | 23 | `taskpacks/history/pre-convergence-20261019/**` |
| Module instructions file (formerly at the `docs/current/` root, named workflow-assistance-AGENTS.md) | 1 | `docs/history/archive/workflow-assistance/module-instructions-20261019.md` |
| Two dated workflow records | 2 | `docs/history/archive/workflow-assistance/{handoffs,audit}/` |

Resulting surfaces: `taskpacks/current/` = 4 tracked files; root Markdown = 5
(`authority=2`, `convention-current=3`, `historical-non-normative=0`); `docs/current/` = 40 md.

**Consumer repointing.** Every active index and consumer was repointed in the same change:
the two governance indexes, `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md`, the open register, `docs/current/**`,
`docs/decisions/**`, `docs/future/**`, Observer design contracts and tests, path constants in
`packages/client-neutral-core/scripts/`, and the anchors/default targets in
`scripts/ci|audit|maintenance`. Frozen `original-tree/**` bytes and the error ledger's historical
citations are deliberately unchanged.

**Fixture changes.** The uppercase-filename falsifiers in
`tests/workflow-assistance/test_control_service.py` and
`tests/workflow-assistance/test_path_text_is_one_predicate.py` no longer depend on a root UI
record: the control-service case now uses root-level `NOTICE.md` (`docs/` is a non-diffable root),
and the predicate case uses the nested archived path and asserts the nested relative result.
`tests/workflow-assistance/test_refs_surface_policies.py` and `tests/workflow-assistance/test_root_document_dispositions.py` use `NOTICE.md` as the
non-authority example.

**Re-index prevention.** `scripts/ci/verify_stale_surface_paths.py` reads the move map and fails
if any old path appears on an active surface. Frozen history, evidence, `knowledge-staging/` and
`.workbuddy/` are out of scope; `taskpacks/current/error-ledger.json` and `AGENTS.md` are named
allowances that must still be used. `tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py`
proves the gate reds on a planted old path and reds on an unused allowance.

**Files changed by this amendment:** the 54 moved paths above; the governance indexes and
consumer files listed in `docs/history/archive/MOVED-PATHS-20261019.json`;
`.project/governance/root-document-dispositions.json`; `scripts/ci/verify_root_document_dispositions.py`;
the four test files named above; `scripts/ci/verify_stale_surface_paths.py` (new);
`tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py` (new); `docs/current/DOCUMENT-CENSUS.md`
(§4, §7, §9, §10 and new §11); and this section.

## 12. Amendment 2026-10-19 (second) — consolidate, then delete (user directive)

**Directive (verbatim):** “旧交接和一些提示词的资料 汇总到一起归档后 就删除了吧”. This overrides the
standing "archive, never delete" convention for the named class only, and only because the bytes
are proved to survive elsewhere first.

Measured result: 91 tracked files matched the handoff/prompt name patterns inside
`docs/history/` and `taskpacks/history/`; **52** were consolidated into
`docs/history/archive/HANDOFFS-AND-PROMPTS-20261019.zip` (first batch: 484,845 B of content, 263,031 B archive,
sha256 recorded in `docs/history/archive/HANDOFFS-AND-PROMPTS-20261019-MANIFEST.json`) and then
`git rm`'d; **4** were kept because a machine pointer or a piece of code reads them by path
(`staticHandoffViews[].entry_record`, `frozenTaskCards[].path`, the citation auditor's fixture name,
and `scripts/ci/generate_current_state.py`'s source list); **35** were excluded by rule -- the byte-frozen
`original-tree/**`, owner inbound records and recovered last copies, imported `session-history/**`,
and the `reports/` + `knowledge-staging/` evidence and third-party-copy surfaces.

Proof before deletion: the manifest records `path`/`bytes`/`sha256`/`crc32` per member, the builder
reopened the archive and compared each member against both its own recorded hash and the bytes on
disk (52/52), and only then did `git rm` run. Recovery is either unzipping at the repository root
or reading the file from Git history, since these were committed before removal.
`tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py` asserts the archive's recorded sha256 against the
shipped bytes, every member's hash/size/CRC32, and that no member is still tracked or still on disk.

25 live citations were repointed to the archive with the member named in place, and the generated
owner-material index now routes its "UI 历史交接" row to the manifest. Post-deletion surfaces,
measured with `git ls-files -z`: 2,550 tracked, `docs/history/` 167 md, `taskpacks/history/` 108,
`docs/current/` 40 md, `taskpacks/current/` 4, repository root 5 md.
**One gate stays red, named and attributed (not worked around):**
`tests/workflow-assistance/test_project_local_citation_audit.py` reports `unadjudicated != 0` on a fresh
scan. Evidence gathered this run: the shipped record's `generatedAt` is 2026-10-10T14:38:39Z（counts.unadjudicated=0, reviewQueue=8, presentOnThisMachine=309） with
`counts.unadjudicated=0`, `reviewQueue=8`, `presentOnThisMachine=309`, last committed in 5f14677d;
the test's corpus is the whole git-ignored `.project-local/` tree (nine days of runtime residue from
several sessions, including this round's scratch scripts), so the drift is not produced by the tracked
changes in §11/§12. The test is not registered in CI -- neither `.github/workflows/` nor the
`services/orchestration/run_quality_gate.py` stage map names it. The audit script also mutates: it disposes
`.project-local/runs/...` directories and rewrites the tracked record; one run this round corrupted that
record and it was restored by bytes. Owner decision needed: reissue the derived audits in the documented
order together with a runtime-residue cleanup, or register the gate, or record it as a local observation.
**First exact-SHA CI verdict after this amendment, and the fix:** pushing `249e5fea` made
`work-lab-gate` run 39226565397 report `aggregate=failure`; the only red module was
`workflow-assistance` -> `test_the_shipped_inventory_describes_the_tree` (gate-plan,
supply-chain-security, integration, observer and token-monitor all success). Cause: the derived
inventory `docs/audits/TOOL_INVENTORY_2026-10-07.json` stores each tool's git-index blob sha256, and
nine `scripts/audit|maintenance` tools edited by §11/§12 still carried their old hashes. Fixed by the
tool's own ordering rule (ERR-151: stage, then re-measure, then commit): after staging,
`scripts/audit/tool_inventory_readback.py` produced `trackedTools=77 withLedgerPromise=19
referencedSomewhere=77 unclaimed=0` and `tests/workflow-assistance/test_tool_inventory_coverage.py`
re-ran `Ran 12 tests / OK`. The new stale-path gate is outside that inventory's scope (it covers
`scripts/audit` and `scripts/maintenance` only); it reaches CI because
`tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py` is discovered by `scripts/ci/run_root_governance_suite.py`.
**A clean-checkout reproduction found two defects in the new control itself, both fixed here.** To avoid
declaring green from local-only evidence, a detached worktree with no `.project-local/` was created and
the six targeted modules re-run there. It immediately reported one failure: the move record's `sha256`
values were computed over **worktree bytes**, while `.gitattributes text=auto` stores LF and checks out
CRLF on Windows, so the two CSVs edited this round could never match on a fresh checkout. Fix: measure the
git blob (`scripts/ci/verify_stale_surface_paths.py:tracked_blob`, via `git show HEAD:<path>`), compare the
record against the blob, and additionally assert that the worktree text equals the blob text modulo line
endings — the only cross-host claim is "the words did not change". Second defect found in the same pass:
regenerating the record reset the named allowances' `minOccurrences` back to hand-written constants (19 and
12) while the measurement is 8 and 6, so the gate convicted itself with `ALLOWANCE_UNMET`; the generator now
calls the gate's own `--write-allowances` after writing, making the minimums a measurement instead of a
constant. The clean worktree then re-ran `Ran 16 tests / OK`.

## 13. Amendment 2026-10-19 (third) — owner authorized the pointer changes

Recorded verbatim from the owner's answers this round: for `AGENTS.md` lines 12 and 16 the answer was
**“授权改这两行”** (authorized to change those two lines), and for the four handoffs kept because a
machine pointer named them the answer was **“删文件并同步改指针”** (delete the files and move the pointers
in the same change). The standing "archive, never delete" convention is overridden for these named
objects only; this is a per-decision authorization, not a new permanent rule.

`AGENTS.md`: the section heading now reads 当前任务范围更新（用户2026-10-19明确决定，取代2026-10-09的UI优先范围）,
the only CURRENT points at this taskpack, and the UI-round handoff routes to `docs/history/archive/HANDOFFS-AND-PROMPTS-20261019.zip` with the member named
in parentheses. Every rule from that section that is still in force (default main line, no mobile work,
HUD as a desktop overlay, single-writer and privacy rules preserved) was carried over verbatim -- fixing a
stale pointer is not a licence to weaken a rule.

Pointers moved: the `staticHandoffViews` entry for HERMES-UPDATE-HANDOFF-20260927 and the `frozenTaskCards`
entry for WORK-LAB-UI-PROMPT-PACK-EXECUTION-TASKCARD-20261007 were removed from
`.project/governance/taskpack-authority-index.json`; the dead `taskpacks/current/` entry in
`scripts/ci/generate_current_state.py`'s source list was dropped -- it had been silently skipped by an
`is_file()` filter, which is the "one evidence source went missing and nobody was told" shape.

**The archive builder had to become cumulative (second self-inflicted defect this round, fixed).** It
originally rewrote the archive from whatever matched today, so when the first 52 documents were already
untracked it produced a 6-member archive: had that been committed, the byte-preservation promise for the
first batch would have been silently void. The builder now reads the shipped archive and manifest,
re-verifies every carried member by sha256 and size, copies those bytes forward untouched, appends the new
additions, refuses to shrink, and excludes the archive and its own manifest by name from the candidate set.
Shipped state measured: **56** members (52 carried forward + 4 added), 492,296 B of content,
268,142 B archive, sha256 `1b1effdf7f80128b4007181dbc7fdb1af01d0776db9ce5f26eb8199d93503347`. The
destructive rewrite was reverted by bytes with `git checkout --` and redone.

Four allowances expired rather than being loosened: the two `AGENTS.md` named allowances in
`docs/history/archive/MOVED-PATHS-20261019.json`, the two rows in
`.project/governance/live-doc-path-exceptions.json`, the two `QUOTED_AS_ABSENT` entries in
`scripts/audit/normalise_doc_citations.py`, and the two `AGENTS.md` rows in the ratchet baseline. The
stale-path gate went from 8 allowances to **4** and reports
`STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_PASS scanned=1289 enforced=104 allowances=4 taskpacks/current/error-ledger.json=8 tests/ci/test_project_authority_reference.py=2 tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py=10 tests/workflow-assistance/test_project_local_citation_audit.py=1`; the baseline reissued at 293 rows.
`tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py` gained a case asserting the four paths are archive members,
absent from the tree, and named by no entry in the machine index.

Surfaces after this amendment, measured with `git ls-files -z`: **2,548** tracked, `docs/history/` 167 md
(unchanged -- all four deleted documents lived under `taskpacks/history/`), `taskpacks/history/` **104**,
`docs/current/` 40 md, `taskpacks/current/` 4, repository root 5 md. The re-index gate reports
`STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_PASS scanned=1289 enforced=104 allowances=4 taskpacks/current/error-ledger.json=8 tests/ci/test_project_authority_reference.py=2 tests/ci/test_stale_surface_paths_are_gone.py=10 tests/workflow-assistance/test_project_local_citation_audit.py=1`, and 106 targeted test cases across eight
modules ran green.
**The gate was extended in the same pass.** `old_patterns()` consumed only the record's `from` paths, so a
pointer at a document that now survives only as an archive member was invisible. The consolidation's 56
`deletedPaths` are enforced too (48 -> **104** patterns), the required gate grew from 16 to **19** cases --
one plants a deleted-member path and must convict, one asserts the live tree names none, one asserts that the
`original-tree/` spelling is *not* convicted (the exclusion has to wrap the whole alternation, not its first
branch), and one pins that the four owner-authorized handoffs are archive members and gone from the tree --
and the population test recomputes its expectation from the record instead of a literal, so growing the record
cannot leave the gate describing an older world.

## 14. Status correction of sections 5/8/10 as of 2026-10-19 (late)

Sections 5, 8 and 10 were written when the minimal-loop product fix was uncommitted, CI had never
judged it, and no AAOS candidate existed. That is no longer the whole picture, so the current state,
measured rather than recalled:

- **Committed and pushed.** `git rev-parse HEAD` equals `git rev-parse @{u}` and the worktree is
  clean (re-measure rather than trusting this line); sections 2's
  baseline (HEAD `0369d349`, `origin/main` `f6077d18`) and the "未提交" wording in section 5 are
  superseded by the archive-normalization commits and the ML-001 upload.
- **Sections 11/12/13 are the record of that work**: 54 tracked moves, 56 documents consolidated
  into one archive and then deleted, `AGENTS.md`'s stale CURRENT lines repointed under explicit owner
  authorization, and the re-index gate that keeps an old or deleted path from returning.
- **What is still true**: exact-SHA CI is the judge of the product change (its verdict for this head is
  appended to the convergence report's test record), the AAOS candidate remains NOT_SUBMITTED,
  merge to `main` remains an owner decision, and the owner-gated governance reds listed in the
  convergence report are unchanged by this round -- the pre-existing set was measured as eight failing
  tests on the run of this round's starting commit `6b6678c3` and the same set (minus anything this
  round introduced, which was fixed) on later runs.
- **A third self-inflicted defect class: a receipt that asserts a state it never measured.** The round's CI
  verdict generator wrote the sentence "工作树干净" as a template constant, so the record for head `263cb8f4`
  stated a false worktree state (three files carrying the citation fix were uncommitted at that moment), and
  the earlier record for `0045017a` stated something merely unmeasured that happened to be true. Both blocks
  are corrected in place in the convergence report, and the generator now counts
  `git status --porcelain -z` entries and prints the measured state plus the dirty count in its own verdict
  line. A field nobody read is not evidence, even when it turns out to be correct.
- **One regression this round created, and its own gate caught it.** The owner-item paragraph written into
  `docs/current/DOCUMENT-CENSUS.md` cited the triage producer by bare basename instead of its full path, so
  `tests/workflow-assistance/test_default_load_doc_citations_resolve.py` failed at head `263cb8f4` with
  "1 citation(s) are still shorthand". The fix was the sanctioned channel -- `scripts/audit/normalise_doc_citations.py`
  run with `--apply` -- which rewrote that single token to `scripts/audit/triage_unbound_ledger_records.py`; the gate is
  then 9/9 green and the normaliser reports `rewritten=0 blocked=0`. Prose is a governed surface: the same gate
  reads what this round writes, and writing the correction above without the full path would itself re-open
  the fault.
- Documentation-only states in section 5 still mean documentation, not features: the minimal loop is
  the only product change authorized so far.

## 15. Amendment 2026-10-19 (fourth) — run this repository standalone; cross-project linkage is deferred

Owner directive, verbatim: **本项目按照独立运行先运行跑通起来   项目联动延后冻结**

Decision: WORK-LAB has to run end to end from its own repository before any linkage with another
project is pursued. Everything whose success depends on a foreign project's data, availability or
interface is deferred or frozen: AAOS candidate submission and its receive-status readback, DESIGN-LAB
design capability, the external source-root inventory under the owner's `Record` material, and
cross-project memory or session federation. Freezing is not closing -- the rows stay in
`taskpacks/current/OPEN-TASK-REGISTER.md` with their existing status and evidence, and no row is
marked complete by this amendment.

**What "standalone run" means here, measured rather than asserted.** The loopback chain is the
product surface: `services/orchestration/sidecar.py` (Workflow-owned, read-only control) answers
`WORKFLOW_SIDECAR_READY` on a random loopback port; `/healthz` returns
`{"ledgerOwner":"workflow-assistance","observerMutation":false,"readOnlyControl":true}`; `/api/v1/snapshot`
returns 200 with schema `workflow/snapshot/v3` (152,058 B measured); the same process serves the built
Vite bundle from `--frontend-root apps/observer/frontend/dist` (200). Rendered against that URL the
Observer showed genuinely live projection -- the snapshot revision advanced 7 to 12 to 17 while the
check ran, a `LIVE` state was present, and absent data stayed `UNKNOWN`
("无执行记录投影 —— 保持 UNKNOWN，不伪造执行行" / "数据源未接入 — 无任务包计数（UNKNOWN）").
Not claimed: pixel-level visual QA. The available in-app browser surface reported a hidden 0x0 viewport,
so only structural/accessibility readings and computed nodes were inspected; geometry assertions are
reported as structural. Receipts: `.project-local/artifacts/standalone-run-20261019/`.

**The defect that blocked the documented one-click entry, fixed.**
`apps/observer/start-observer.cmd` opened a static HTML path under a directory this repository does not
contain, while polling a hardcoded port that the sidecar never binds (it starts with `--port 0`). Both
halves of the documented chain were unrunnable, and neither was guarded -- the sibling
`tests/ci/test_sidecar_documented_launch.py` proves the command starts, not that a launcher reaches a UI.
The launcher now deletes a stale endpoint descriptor, starts the sidecar with `--frontend-root`, reads
`projectionUrl` out of the endpoint descriptor the sidecar writes under the runtime root, and opens that
origin with the descriptor's own loopback URL injected as `?api=` (the frontend marks such an injected descriptor authoritative; the static-preview
default does not). `apps/observer/README.md` now documents the same command shape. Guard:
`tests/ci/test_observer_launcher_chain_is_runnable.py` (6 cases, auto-discovered by the `tests/ci/` glob);
falsified by planting the original two defects, which produced `2 failed, 4 passed`, then restored
byte-identically (sha256 prefix `fe28fa0059a09e78`).

**Boundaries that hold under standalone operation.** The Task Ledger source
`.hermes/task-runtime/task-ledger/ledger.json` [no-tree-claim CLIENT_HOME ref=.hermes/task-runtime/task-ledger/ledger.json]
is absent in this checkout, so task counts are honestly `UNKNOWN` rather than zero; external client adapters
return `UNAVAILABLE` when a client is missing, and
no step of the chain above reads another project's files. The Observer stayed read-only throughout:
only GET requests were issued and every non-GET is refused with 405 by the sidecar.

**Next slice inside this decision, not authorized yet:** the desktop (Tauri) entry is the packaged
surface and was not launched here; if the owner wants the exe path proven rather than the loopback path,
that is the next explicit grant.

### 15.1 The interface half of "standalone run" (same day, owner: 界面呢，按最新规划更新完成)

Measured gap, not an opinion: the frontend contract pins 22 v3 snapshot keys and the Observer's own source
consumed 20 of them. `artifactHandles` and `artifactHandlesSummary` had **zero consumers** -- the sidecar
was already publishing 200 projected handle rows (of 5,024 enumerated, 4,824 omitted, 231 sensitive names
refused, 114 regenerable directories pruned, 40 rows carrying a digest and 160 not) and nothing rendered
them. That is the definition of a declared fact that never reaches a reader.

- Gate added: `scripts/ci/verify_snapshot_keys_rendered.py` reads the pinned key list out of
  `apps/observer/frontend/src/contractConformance.ts` (it does not retype the list), ignores comment lines
  and type/contract declarations, and counts only real reads (`.key`, `?.key`, bracket or destructure
  form). Guard: `tests/ci/test_snapshot_keys_are_rendered.py` -- 6 cases, of which 4 are planted
  falsifiers (an orphan key is named; a key mentioned only in a comment stays unrendered; a key mentioned
  only in `apps/observer/frontend/src/types.ts` stays unrendered; the pinned list cannot be emptied silently). The suite's own
  discovery reports 56 modules and includes this one, so it runs in CI without registration.
- Interface change: the evidence lane now carries a handle block -- capacity line, neutral window
  disclosure, refusal-bounded partial-failure card, surface/digest filters that live in the address, and
  the row list with per-cell `data-origin` markers. Contract: `apps/observer/frontend/src/views/evidenceHandles.contract.test.tsx`
  (26 cases) plus the pre-existing truth sweep; `npm run typecheck` clean, 43 cases green across the three
  affected files.
- Two defects found and fixed while looking at the painted result, both caught by the eye before any gate
  existed: a by-design cap truncation was being announced with the red `partial-failure` card (the
  vocabulary binds that state to `artifactHandlesSummary.refused`, so the card is now driven by refusals
  and truncation is a neutral line), and the 21-cell bookkeeping grid sat above the rows and the filters.
- Contract mismatch found on the way, still open: `apps/observer/frontend/src/types.ts` declared
  `refused.droppedOnVerification` as `number` while the producer
  `packages/client-neutral-core/scripts/artifact_handle_projection.py` publishes a `dict[str, int]`
  (measured `{}` in the live snapshot). The interface type was corrected to `Record<string, number>`; the
  producer-side naming stays as it is, and this line is the record that the two disagreed before it.
- Render evidence: `scripts/audit/evidence_handles_render_via_headless_chromium.py` paints the lane in real
  Chromium at 1280x820, 1280x2600 and the 900x600 floor and records every attempt, including the timeouts.
  It deliberately claims nothing about fonts or geometry -- `--dump-dom` never returns while the event
  stream is open, and a PNG byte count is not a populated-ness test; legibility and rects belong to
  `scripts/audit/text_legibility_via_cdp.py` and `scripts/audit/topbar_geometry_via_cdp.py`.
- Live-page probe against the running chain (real Chromium, populated): 160 rows rendered under
  `handlesDigest=unrecorded`, which equals the backend's own `rowsWithoutDigest`; rows precede the fact
  grid; minimum computed font size 12px; `data-origin` counts PROJECTED 821 / NULL_FIELD 161; no
  content-read or retry control inside the block; the block also refused a bad filter value I put in the
  URL and said so instead of silently ignoring it.

### 15.2 The polish pass the owner asked for (same night: 界面呢…该修复的修复该更新的更新)

Two independent reviews were run against the delivered block before polishing it, and both changed what
I believed. The design review sampled pixels and found the `partial-failure` card is **not** red (ink-white
title, primary-blue icon) — my own earlier reading of the screenshot had called it a red fault card, which
was wrong; the real defect was that a page-level state shell gives a long-term norm full-screen weight.
The refactor review read the code and found the file had grown to the repository's largest (1,042 lines,
48% of it handle-specific), plus two truth defects and a URL-preservation hole.

Delivered, each with its own assertion:
- `apps/observer/frontend/src/views/EvidenceView.tsx` 1,042 → 525 lines; the handle block lives in
  `apps/observer/frontend/src/views/EvidenceHandles.tsx` (557), following the existing precedent of
  `apps/observer/frontend/src/views/AdapterCapabilityCards.tsx` rather than inventing a new layer.
  The no-hardcoded-numbers check that reads the component source was re-pointed at the new file and proved
  still sharp: pointing it back at the old file makes it exit 1.
- Two truth defects fixed: the block claimed "this producer does not send surfaceRoot" while the measured
  snapshot carries it on 200/200 rows; and an absent `droppedOnVerification` key printed as "0", turning a
  missing field into a value. Both now have two-sided tests (present prints the value, absent prints 未提供).
- Terminology unified for readers (handle is 把手 everywhere, not 句柄 in one panel and 把手 in another), and
  the three meanings of 投影 were separated in prose: window rows, snapshot-delivered counts, and the
  `PROJECTED` provenance marker. Identifiers and `data-*` values were not touched. Re-measured after the
  commit: `句柄` occurs 0 times under `src/`, `把手` 17 times in the handle block, and the source-reading
  check opens `apps/observer/frontend/src/views/EvidenceHandles.tsx`.
- The refusal card gained a `compact` presentation on `ProductStateCard` (class only, no new colours); the
  state, its label, counts, 依据 and 下一步 are unchanged, so the meaning cannot be softened by the styling.
- `handlesSurface`/`handlesDigest`/`palette` are preserved when an evidence address is built, so clicking a
  source no longer silently drops the filter; the artifact address deliberately does not inherit them.

Docs corrected where they had rotted, not where they were merely ugly:
`apps/observer/frontend/src/lib/legacyRoutes.ts` said "the 23 legacy routes" while 26 `seedId` rows are
measured, so the count left the comment; `apps/observer/frontend/DESIGN.md` and
`apps/observer/frontend/SCREEN_SPEC.md` now attribute the 12px floor and the AA ratios to the instrument and
its receipt instead of restating a census number as a permanent fact;
`docs/current/DOCUMENT-CENSUS.md` gained §14 and the
`docs/current/authority-convergence-20261019/ROADMAP.md` table gained this round's rows;
`docs/audits/TOOL_INVENTORY_2026-10-07.json` was re-measured and reissued in the
same commit as the documents that cite it.

A guard I wrote this round was itself found defective, by a clean checkout rather than by opinion:
`tests/ci/test_observer_launcher_chain_is_runnable.py` asserted that `apps/observer/frontend/dist/index.html`
exists, but `dist/` is gitignored, so a fresh clone reports a red that is about the environment, not the
launcher (CI builds first, which is why the pipeline never showed it). The test now pins the launcher to the
directory the build is configured to write, asserts the tracked Vite source root exists, and states
explicitly when the bundle is simply not built. Re-planting the original defect in that disposable checkout
convicts three cases and restores byte-identically.

Re-measured after the split, because "the tests are green" is not "the page still paints" (a rebuilt bundle,
real Chromium, live backend, both themes, 1280px; the receipt names the bundle it painted,
`bundleDigest=7626fd5135ac482a…`): 31 views reached, 2,933 text nodes per theme, 0 below the 12px floor,
0 AA failures, 0 thin views, every lane showing its own content rather than the offline panel, and tone
components actually on screen (`tag.bg-panel2.text-muted` 48, `tag.info` 14, `tag.ok` 11, `tag.warn` 9) --
receipt `.project-local/artifacts/standalone-run-20261019/21-legibility-after-split.json`. The below-the-fold
population is measured, not assumed: all 31 lanes carry scrollable regions (82 regions swept) and every one
of them gained text nodes once swept -- overview 77→131, environment 48→129, agents 57→139 -- which is what
the pre-split census could not claim. Paints at the repository's own window sizes, including the 900x600
floor, are in `.project-local/artifacts/standalone-run-20261019/15-evidence-paint.json`; one capture attempt
timed out and the receipt records the attempt, not just the retry.

What the sweep does *not* cover, measured rather than assumed: a direct DOM read of the live evidence lane
(`.project-local/runs/standalone-20261019/probe-rows-clean.txt`) shows the split block does render its
population -- 200 row children, 1,200 `data-origin` cells, a 23,031px-tall list, the capacity line reading
"投影 200 行 / 上限 200，省略 4912 行" and the first row carrying a real handle path. The sweep sampled 143
text nodes on that lane, because its per-lane budget is 16 viewport-sized harvest steps and 23,031px at a
748px viewport needs ~31. So "0 below the floor, 0 AA failures" was a verdict over a sample.
That gap is now the instrument's own problem to state: every lane reports `presentNodes` (the same leaf
predicate minus the viewport test) and `sweepStopsUsed`/`sweepStopsNeeded`, a lane omitting them is
convicted by `coverage_was_reported`, and a lane whose sampled count exceeds what the page holds -- a
double-counting merge -- is convicted by `sampled_nodes_stay_within_the_measured_population`. Re-run against
the same bundle, both themes: **sampled 2,933 of 8,006 leaf texts, sweep stops 298 of 564**, receipt
`.project-local/artifacts/standalone-run-20261019/22-legibility-sampling.json`. The rail's green now carries
its denominator, so nobody can read it as "every row was looked at"; raising the budget to close that 37%
is a separate decision with a runtime cost, and it is now a number rather than an assumption.

Verification, measured: `npm run typecheck` clean; 77 tests green across the four affected frontend files
(33 of them the handle contract); `npm run build` ok; `scripts/ci/verify_snapshot_keys_rendered.py` still
`rendered=22 unrendered=0`; the launcher guard 7 passed; the anti-re-index gate
`STALE_SURFACE_PATHS_PASS scanned=1295 enforced=104 allowances=4`; the inventory-currency single case
1 passed (147 s). The citation pass first reported `rewritten=11` against the paths written above, then
`rewritten=0` once they were canonical -- this section is the proof that the guard bites my own prose.
Locked as `2b7cf459e98ab9530c1cda11ef1f92889ffa8f6a` and pushed to `docs/handoff-20261018-qoder`.

What the branch does to its own CI is now measured, not assumed: `.github/workflows/work-lab-gate.yml`
declares `cancel-in-progress` for every ref except `main`, so a push closes the run of the head before it.
The run at `5267882b` shows what that costs a reader: its `observer` and `token-monitor` jobs report
`cancelled` while `workflow-assistance` reports `failure` and `aggregate` closes the run as `failure`. A
verdict read at a superseded head therefore cannot separate "this surface is bad" from "this job was
stopped", and a cancelled job carries no evidence about its own surface at all. The verdict that is readable
and the verdict that is owed are both at the newest pushed head; a chain of per-head verdicts on this branch
is not obtainable by waiting. Exact-SHA verdict blocks live in
`docs/current/authority-convergence-20261019/AUTHORITY-CONVERGENCE-20261019.md`, not here.
