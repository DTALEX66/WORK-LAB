"""Launch constraints for WORK-LAB-managed Hermes invocations (review finding A-3).

Observed behaviour: ``hermes chat --ignore-user-config`` is **not** a "no model"
mode. It falls back to a built-in default and calls ``openrouter`` / ``z-ai/glm-5.2``
against the user's real account, which returned HTTP 402 on cost grounds
(``max_tokens`` 131072 far above the affordable budget). That route is not
declared in the user's ``config.yaml``.

Scope, stated precisely
-----------------------
This constrains **only** launches that WORK-LAB manages: its adapters, gates,
tests and any script it runs. It cannot and does not govern commands the user
types by hand, and it does not delete or disable the OpenRouter credentials,
which may serve other approved purposes. The claim is "WORK-LAB's own entry
points do not take this route", not "the user's manual commands are controlled".

The check is deliberately a hard failure rather than a warning: a managed run
that reaches an unapproved provider is a cost-boundary violation, and the
ruling classifies it as blocking for automated release.
