"""Three-way managed-asset guard for the portable Hermes sync.

Design constraints this module must satisfy (independent-review findings
R1, R2, R4, R6):

* **No adoption bypass.** Recording a baseline for live content is a separate,
  explicit operation that touches no asset bytes. It never lets a publish skip
  the refusal checks, and it can only cover targets an operator named together
  with the exact digest they reviewed. (R1)
* **Converged targets are not rewritten.** Only ``CLEAN_UPDATE`` targets are
  published, and every target that will be written is re-evaluated immediately
  before the write. (R2)
* **Deleting a known asset is drift, not a fresh install.** A target that has a
  recorded baseline but is missing live is refused; only a target with no
  baseline at all is created. (R4)
* **The commit is diagnosable, not pretended to be transactional.** A pending
  marker names the run id, the frozen candidate digests and the phase reached,
  so an interrupted run can be classified instead of guessed. (R6)

The module stays pure policy: digests are supplied by the caller so it cannot
drift from the sync's own digest definition.

Verdicts
--------
CONVERGED           live already equals the candidate      -> NOT written
CLEAN_UPDATE        live equals the recorded baseline      -> written
                    (or absent with no baseline: new install)
DELETED_DRIFT       baseline exists but live is missing    -> REFUSE
UNKNOWN_LIVE_CHANGE live differs from baseline & candidate -> REFUSE
NO_BASELINE         live exists with no recorded provenance -> REFUSE
CANDIDATE_ABSENT    repository source is missing           -> REFUSE
SUSPENDED           operator-suspended unit                -> NOT written
