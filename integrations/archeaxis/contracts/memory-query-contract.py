"""ArcheAxis memory-query seam — WORK-LAB V2 three-project boundary.

WORK-LAB keeps only the QUERY surface (it asks, it does not store).
The memory BACKEND (retain/recall/reflect, long-term store, provider,
import) migrates to DTALEX66/ArcheAxis-Knowledge-OS.

This module is the single allowed import path for any WORK-LAB code that
needs to reach memory. Anything that stores/retains/recalls LENDING is a
boundary violation caught by scripts/ci/verify_three_project_boundary.py.
