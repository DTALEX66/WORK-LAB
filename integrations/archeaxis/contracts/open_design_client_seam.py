"""Open Design client seam — WORK-LAB V2 three-project boundary.

Open Design is a CLIENT that WORK-LAB manages (the Open Design
USER_GLOBAL desired state): rules, skills, plugins, capability discovery,
workflow policy, adapter, software state.

DESIGN-LAB is a SEPARATE PROJECT that owns the design DOMAIN: design
knowledge, design prompt truth, design assets, generation strategy, design
quality system, Adobe domain logic. WORK-LAB neither collects nor manages
any of those (IGNORE), and it must not grow a design-capability owner.

This module is the single allowed surface for WORK-LAB's Open Design client
management. Anything that stores design prompt truth / assets / quality
inside WORK-LAB is a boundary violation caught by
scripts/ci/verify_three_project_boundary.py.

Field ownership: config/config-ownership.json (adapter "open-design",
  external project "design-lab-project").
