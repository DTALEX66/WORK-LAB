"""WLGM-230 canary runner — WORK-LAB self-canary (no external project writes).

Runs the real identity resolver + aggregator against the WORK-LAB repository
itself to validate the multi-scenario matrix that does NOT require external
project authorization:

1. WORK-LAB root resolves to the work-lab product project;
2. submodules/modules resolve as working areas of the same project, never as
   new projects;
3. a transient nested-repo path stays unresolved (independent repository);
4. weak evidence alone never produces RUNNING;
5. snapshot revision increments across publishes.

External OS-project canary (real second project) stays PENDING until the user
authorizes ``WORKLAB_CANARY_PROJECT_ROOTS`` and read access to an external repo.
