"""Execution anchor / session lineage model (WLGM-040).

A session's *anchor project* must not drift just because the agent briefly
reads another repository. This module models:

- ``ExecutionAnchor``: the stable project an execution belongs to;
- ``currentWorkingArea``: where the agent is working right now;
- ``visitedRepositories``: repositories touched transiently (never migrates the
  anchor);
- lineage: ``sessionLineage`` keeps the chain across compression/resume/fork so
  a lost cwd degrades path quality instead of reassigning the project.

Pure data model + switch policy: no IO.
