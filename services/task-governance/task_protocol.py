"""Task Protocol V2 (WL-170): three delivery modes + risk-based upgrades.

The taskpack (ch 15) defines how a task is *shaped* before work starts:

* **Native**    — single session, small task.  No portable artifacts.
* **Portable**  — crosses session / agent / model / machine.  Emits the
                  portable triple ``contract.json`` + ``events.jsonl`` +
                  ``capsule.md``.
* **Audited**   — high-risk tasks (release / migration / delete / security /
                  license / evolution).  The portable triple PLUS
                  ``independent evaluator`` + ``typed receipt`` +
                  ``owner epoch`` + ``rollback`` + ``human approval``.

This module is *pure policy*: it classifies a task, enumerates exactly what
the chosen mode demands, and validates that a claimed completion actually
carries those artifacts.  It is the shared contract that Completion
Authority (ch 16) and the Permission Gate (ch 18) both check against —
nobody downstream re-invents the list.

Loading convention (services/ has no package __init__.py): sibling modules
reference each other through the stable ``sys.modules`` name so enums and
types stay singletons.
