"""Completion Authority (WL-180): evidence-gated acceptance of work.

Ch 16 is blunt: the pattern ``Worker says DONE -> PASS`` is *forbidden*.
A task is accepted only when it travels the full chain::

    Worker output  ->  Evidence  ->  Verification  ->  Independent check
                 ->  Manager acceptance  ->  PASS

This module models that chain as a **typed, ordered ledger** so that a
caller cannot skip a link or pass a bare "done" claim:

* every link records *who* produced it and *what* they saw;
* the final acceptance is only minted once every required link is present
  and the task mode's artifact/extras contract (Task Protocol V2) holds;
* the record is JSON-serialisable and carries a content hash so the same
  acceptance can be re-verified offline.

Audited-mode tasks additionally require the high-risk extras named by the
protocol (independent evaluator, typed receipt, owner epoch, rollback,
human approval) — completion authority *reads* that contract, it does not
redefine it, so there is exactly one source of truth.

Loading convention mirrors services/session-federation: no package
``__init__.py``; sibling modules are loaded through a stable ``sys.modules``
name so shared enums stay singletons.
