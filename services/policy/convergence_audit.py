"""Module/language/dependency + skill lifecycle + model diff convergence audit.

integrated-taskpack-20260916 NF-10 / NF-11 / NF-12 closeout.  Everything here
is read-only and deterministic, and consumes ONLY git-tracked repository facts
(so it never reaches across projects into user global state such as
``~/.agents/skills``, and it never invents a measured "savings %" it did not
actually measure).

NF-10  (skill lifecycle): a task is served by a skill's name + trigger
        description alone; the full body is read only on selection.  The user
        native provider/model/reasoning/hook/MCP/plugin fields are protected:
        they may be OBSERVE/FORBIDDEN but are NEVER in a managed write set.
        14 global backups are out of this repository's scope and are NOT read.

NF-11  (dependency / runnable convergence): the dependency manifests are the
        registered toolchains; apps/ holds exactly the known top-level apps
        (no second Observer, no generic agent service), services/ holds only
        the known owned modules.

NF-12  (model diff): per-adapter version/capability diff against the
        adapter-registry.  With no real model call, behavior is UNKNOWN (never
        "passed"); an unaffected layer yields NO_CHANGE.
