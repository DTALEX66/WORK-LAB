"""WLG-030: global validation-tier vocabulary and event contract.

The global layer defines exactly these tiers; each project maps its own
semantic gates to them. WORK-LAB never adds a command the project did not
declare, and never interprets full/exact-SHA on a project's behalf.

Events below are the canonical cross-project observation events.
