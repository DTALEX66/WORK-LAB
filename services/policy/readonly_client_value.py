"""Read-only client value loop (integrated-taskpack-20260916 NF-05 / NF-06).

Aggregates a client adapter's probe evidence (installed / version / supported
capabilities) into a desensitized, write-free value receipt. This is a pure
function over in-memory records: it never shells out, never reads credentials
or private session stores, never writes live config, and never calls a paid
model API. A simulated adapter is flagged so it can never enter the real
applied-success tally.

The receipt answers NF-06 ("one real client's read-only value closed loop")
while staying strictly read-only: what is installed, what is confirmed
supported (with version + entry evidence), what is an honest capability gap
(NOT displayed as "adapted"), and the next step.
