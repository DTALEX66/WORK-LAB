"""WLG-100: global config apply safety contract.

Every apply must follow:
  plan -> diff -> approval -> backup -> atomic apply -> readback -> rollback

Rules:
- official config schema wins;
- unknown fields preserved (OBSERVE/quarantine, never silently deleted);
- provider/model/auth default OBSERVE (never auto-apply);
- no cross-client sync of prompt/skill/memory/session bodies;
- apply failure must never leave the client unstartable.
