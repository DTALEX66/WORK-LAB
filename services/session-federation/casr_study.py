"""CASR architecture study (WL-P1-100 / ch 14): REFERENCE_ONLY by design.

ch 14 names one research target — the external
``cross_agent_session_resumer`` — and six capability dimensions to study::

    Canonical IR / Reader-Writer / read-back verification /
    native writer / round trip / loss accounting

and one hard constraint that decides the deliverable's SHAPE: the
upstream project's license carries an extra rider, so its core code MUST
NOT be copied into the WORK-LAB core.  The status is REFERENCE_ONLY.

That makes this a STUDY, not an integration — the same shape as the
Beads POC (ch 22): assess a capability against what WORK-LAB already owns,
record the mapping, and reach a verdict without vendoring the other side's
code.  The conclusion a correct study must reach is structural, not
optimistic::

    REFERENCE_ONLY — keep the design as reference material; do NOT port
    the upstream core (license rider); reuse WORK-LAB's own
    session-federation plane for the same capability where it already
    covers it.

Each of the six dimensions is scored against WORK-LAB's existing
session-federation components (canonical session, portability levels,
L1 handoff, loss report, ACP facade), and the receipt carries a
deterministic hash so the study is reproducible and citable.
