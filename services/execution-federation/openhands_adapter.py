"""OpenHands executor adapter (WL-200 / OPENHANDS_POC).

ch 19 positions OpenHands as a *FleetBackend / RemoteExecutionBackend /
AutomationBackend* POC — it is deliberately **not** a Policy / Evidence /
Knowledge authority.  The adapter therefore advertises only the execution
surface (launch when the backend is reachable, session, stream, cancel)
and defers all governance to the WORK-LAB planes (policy gate, completion
authority, evidence ledger).

The constructor is DI-friendly: a ``reachable`` flag (or a backend URL the
test can stand up) drives launchability; the default reports *not
launchable* so the federation registry never silently claims a remote
backend it has not been told about.
