"""Pi executor adapter (WL-220 / WL-P1-170 PI_EXECUTOR).

ch 21 is explicit that Pi is a *research* executor — minimal agent core,
provider-neutral API, telemetry, lightweight execution — and that **Pi
itself does not provide full file / process / network permission
governance, so it cannot carry WORK-LAB's Policy**.  This adapter
therefore:

* advertises only lightweight execution + telemetry + trace;
* is honest that it is *not* a launchable first-class citizen in a managed
  environment unless explicitly injected as reachable;
* always tags :class:`capabilities` notes with "policy is enforced by the
  WORK-LAB Permission Gate, not by Pi", so no downstream consumer can
  mistake Pi for an authority.
