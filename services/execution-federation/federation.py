"""Executor federation registry — one control plane over all executors.

ch 0 (final positioning) makes WORK-LAB the *client-neutral control plane*
over seven clients.  The Execution Federation Plane (ch 1, ch 17) says the
federation itself is what WORK-LAB owns: a single registry that can

* enumerate every registered executor and its honest capabilities,
* route an ACP operation (new / resume / prompt / stream / cancel / fork /
  permission / capabilities) to the right adapter, and
* aggregate a federation-wide health snapshot for the governance /
  evidence / evaluation planes above it.

The registry is deliberately *passive*: it never launches, spawns, reads
credentials, or applies policy on its own.  Policy decisions flow through
the WORK-LAB Permission Gate (Phase 3); the registry only *tells you what
each executor can do* so the gate and the completion authority can reason
over the whole fleet at once.

Loading convention matches the rest of services/ — no package
``__init__.py``; the base adapter is loaded through the stable module name
so the shared enums stay singletons.
