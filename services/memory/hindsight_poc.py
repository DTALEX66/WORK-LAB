"""Hindsight memory POC provider (ch 24 bakeoff candidate).

ch 24 records that Hindsight supports retain / recall / reflect across a
large set of coding agents and offers Windows + local/self-hosted
operation.  This POC provider fronts Hindsight through the same unified
9-op contract as the Hermes builtin so the bakeoff can score them on
identical axes.

Honesty rules for a POC:
* the provider only *serves* when handed a live Hindsight store handle
  (``backend``).  A bare POC with no backend reports UNAVAILABLE from
  every mutating op and [] from recall — it does NOT fabricate a recall
  and does NOT claim Hindsight is running when it is not.
* the POC implements the three Hindsight-native tiers (retain/recall/
  reflect); the import_* and export tiers are reported as
  NOT_SUPPORTED so the bakeoff scores Hindsight's real surface, not an
  imagined one.
