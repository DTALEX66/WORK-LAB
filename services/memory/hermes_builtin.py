"""Hermes builtin memory provider (the one WORK-LAB owns end-to-end).

Of the three bakeoff candidates in ch 24, Hermes builtin / provider is the
only one WORK-LAB fully controls: it has no external server to reach, so it
is the one candidate that can *serve* in a self-hosted, offline, Windows
environment without installing anything.

Construction is dependency-injected: pass a live ``backend`` (an object
implementing the minimal ``get/put/delete`` surface of a memory store) to
make the provider *available*; without one it still exposes the interface
and reports itself as unavailable — the honest default for a bare
environment.
