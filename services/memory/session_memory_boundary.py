"""Session / Memory / Knowledge boundary (WL-P0-210 / ch 25).

ch 25 defines three layers that MUST stay separate and names two hard
forbiddens::

    Session   = raw work history / event / tool / state
    Memory    = distilled, reusable experience
    Knowledge = verified assets that have entered ArcheAxis

    FORBIDDEN:  treat a Memory DB as a Session DB
    FORBIDDEN:  push raw Session logs straight into ArcheAxis

This module makes those two forbiddens *structurally impossible* rather
than a policy footnote:

* a **session store** accepts only raw-session-shaped payloads and is the
  ONLY place they may live; it never distils and never writes to memory.
* a **memory provider** accepts only already-distilled :class:`MemoryRecord`
  instances — handing it a raw session payload raises
  :class:`SessionAsMemoryError`.
* the **knowledge sink** accepts only a MEMORY-tier record that carries an
  explicit ``verified`` attestation — handing it a raw session (or an
  unverified memory) raises :class:`RawLogToKnowledgeError` /
  :class:`UnverifiedPromotionError` respectively.

The result is a one-way pipeline::

    raw session  ->  [explicit distill]  ->  memory  ->  [verified]  ->  knowledge

and no shortcut edge skips a stage.
