"""Multi-evidence state aggregator (WLGM-130).

Builds a trustworthy project-activity projection from execution facts:

- every execution keeps its own state; project aggregation never overrides
  execution detail;
- strong evidence (A/B/C) wins, weak evidence (D/E) only supplements;
- evidence TTL + late-event window;
- 15s without updates -> DELAYED, 60s -> LOST (thresholds configurable);
- a missing terminal state never auto-completes;
- WAITING_USER / WAITING_APPROVAL / BLOCKED are separate states;
- multiple agents on one project show counts and platform distribution;
- source conflicts lower quality and keep an explanation.

State transitions are validated: no illegal transitions (property-style).
