"""Final audit (WL-430 / ch 42 + ch 44 item 20): the G01-G14 gate set.

ch 42 defines fourteen acceptance gates, G01..G14, and one rule that
trumps all of them::

    any single gate failing -> Promotion is forbidden.

This is the final audit of the Phase-1 (and whole taskpack) done-when:
ch 44 item 20 is "G01-G14 PASS".  Each gate is evaluated from evidence the
caller supplies — a gate with NO evidence is PENDING, never a guessed
PASS (the honest default), and a gate whose evidence is negative is FAIL.
Promotion is allowed only when all fourteen are PASS.

Gates that are live-environment dependent (CI green, secret scan, Windows
run) report their status exactly as the evidence says; when that evidence
has not been produced, the gate is PENDING so a later run can close it —
this module does not fabricate a green.
