"""Spill cleanup decisions (WL-410 / ch 44 item 2 + the standing no-delete rule).

ch 44 says ``.project-local`` becomes WORK-LAB's local runtime root, and the
repo's own hygiene rules say: clean only what is proven useless or
regenerable, and ALWAYS keep runtime state, logs, sessions and recovery
backups.  WL-410 takes the spill rows the repo-slimming auditor produced
(ch 34's spill-report.json) and turns each one into a DECISION — it never
deletes.

Four dispositions, each with an explicit, reversible reason:

    KEEP_IN_PLACE    sanctioned runtime / session / recovery state — leave it
    MIGRATE          generated data that belongs under .project-local — move it
    REGENERATE_OK    proven build/dependency/cache output — safe to rebuild,
                     and only then remove the stale copy
    BLOCKED          touches a shared / unknown / credential-adjacent state —
                     stop, ask the user; do not act on it

A decision that would remove something not proven-regenerable, or that hits
a shared runtime root, is BLOCKED by construction, not "clean up later".
