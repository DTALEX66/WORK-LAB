"""Independent evolution gate (WL-340 / ch 29): the ch 29 acceptance path.

ch 29 FORBIDS the self-reinforcing loop::

    Penguin modifies -> Penguin evaluates -> Penguin promotes itself

and REQUIRES the full independent path::

    Baseline -> Candidate -> Independent benchmark -> Holdout ->
    Regression -> Security -> Cost -> Latency -> Evaluator ->
    WORK-LAB Promotion Gate

This module owns the verdict.  Two invariants are structural, not
discouraged-by-convention:

* the Evaluator that scores a candidate MUST be a different authority
  from the producer of that candidate (ch 29's whole point);
* promotion is the last stage and only WORK-LAB's promotion gate
  grants it — never the evaluator or the producer.
