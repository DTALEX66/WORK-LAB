"""Control Surface service (P1-06 / AG-15 / T04): the loopback-only write boundary.

Why this exists as its own process and not as extra routes on the Observer: ``apps/observer`` is
permanently strictly read-only (AGENTS.md, ``apps/observer/AGENTS.md``,
``scripts/ci/verify_observer_readonly_boundary.py``). A unified UI may offer both kinds of surface, but
the read-only service must never hold a write path. So this module is the only place a control request
is accepted, and it delegates every decision to the control plane that already exists —
``services/task-governance/permission_gate.py`` for authorisation and the workflow-owned canonical store
for state — instead of inventing a second ledger, a second receipt engine or a second approval flow.

Rules this module enforces rather than assumes:

* loopback only, dynamic port, and an endpoint descriptor the shell discovers — never a fixed production port;
* the operation enum is closed, and an operation without a native capability answers ``NOT_IMPLEMENTED``
  with its own reason. It never returns a success shape, and no caller-supplied field can raise the
  evidence level: an in-repo fixture store is SYNTHETIC, a live local store is INTEGRATED, and REAL is
  reserved for a verifiable native handle plus readback, which a local write is not;
* ``plan != write``: the config operations that only compute a diff say so, and the ones that would write
  to a target outside this repository answer REFUSED until an exact target is authorised;
* ``authorized != executed``: ``work-unit.materialize`` is the consumer side of the AG-16 planning
  handback. It re-runs ``plan_candidate.check_candidate`` server-side on every call against the local
  authorization record, so a client that sends ``{"authorized": true}`` — or a whole verdict object — in
  the payload changes nothing but the refusal text naming the claim it ignored. What lands is the work
  unit the candidate describes (status QUEUED, read back from the store); what never lands here is the
  plan's execution, which stays behind ``work-unit.dispatch`` until an executor has a native receipt;
* the goal text a Work Unit carries stays in the store. The read-only Observer projection deliberately
  publishes checkpoint key names and a digest, never the values, so a control write cannot smuggle a
  prompt body into the Observer.
