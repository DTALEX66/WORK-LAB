"""Beads Task Graph POC (WL-P0-180 / ch 22): a coverage assessment, not a port.

The taskpack positions this item as a *comparison*, and it states the
conclusion up front: *do not make Beads the source of truth (SSOT)*.  What
this module actually delivers is that conclusion *backed by evidence*, not
a re-implementation of Beads (installing Beads or a Dolt backend would be
exactly the out-of-scope external dependency the taskpack warns against).

Approach
--------

WORK-LAB already owns a mature task-graph primitive in
``packages/client-neutral-core/scripts/task_ledger.py`` — a single-file,
append-JSON, lease-fenced, dependency-checked ``TaskLedger``.  This module
maps each of the ten capability dimensions the taskpack lists for the POC

    dependency graph / atomic claim / long task / concurrent agents /
    Dolt / resume / hierarchy / memory decay / JSON / Windows

onto the *specific, verified* TaskLedger API that covers it, records a
coverage verdict per dimension, and produces a deterministic, hashable
report whose top-line conclusion is::

    beads_as_ssot = False

Because two dimensions — **Dolt** (versioned git-like storage) and
**memory decay** (time-weighted recall) — have no equivalent in the current
TaskLedger, they are the concrete, evidenced reasons Beads cannot be dropped
in as the single source of truth without changing WORK-LAB's storage model
and introducing an external dependency.

The module is pure: it imports no Beads, no Dolt, and nothing networked.
It reads the capability map (curated against the real TaskLedger API) and
emits a JSON-serialisable report with a content hash so the POC verdict is
reproducible offline.
