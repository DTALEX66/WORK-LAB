"""Auto POC routing (WL-390): route a scored candidate to its disposition.

Given the ch 33 tiers this module maps each scored candidate to a
disposition and — for the ones that warrant hands-on work — the exact
next gate that must run before anything lands.  The routing is the seam
between the Radar Plane and the Security / Evolution planes:

* P0_AUDIT  (85+)   -> run the full audit (skill / extension pipeline)
                       before any install; WORK-LAB holds the verdict.
* P1_POC    (70-84) -> build a POC behind its provider interface; the
                       external artifact stays register-and-recipe.
* REFERENCE (55-69) -> record it as a reference; no active work.
* ARCHIVE   (<55)   -> archive; revisit only on a future radar sweep.

Two load-bearing guards:

* a P0_AUDIT candidate CANNOT skip the audit and be installed directly —
  routing to "install" for an unaudited candidate is a structural error
  (ch 41: the acceptance authority is WORK-LAB's gate, not the radar).
* routing is deterministic + receipt-hashed, and it never invents a
  candidate's capability the metadata did not carry.
