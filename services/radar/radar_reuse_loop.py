"""Offline radar reuse-loop + price-identity normalization (WL-R01 / WL-R07).

Pure, deterministic, no-network, no paid calls, no sibling import (gate-safe,
following the NF-02 convention).  It consumes the EXISTING contracts rather
than inventing a second radar platform:

  WL-R01  A fixed offline sample is persisted (JSON), replayed, version-diffed,
          and rendered into a Chinese candidate report that assigns each
          candidate one of the five reuse verdicts (DIRECT_DEPENDENCY /
          PROVIDER / ADAPTER / ALGORITHM_DONOR / REFERENCE_ONLY / REJECTED)
          with license + version + retire-reason + evidence level.  A receipt
          (sha256) proves the same sample replayed produces the SAME candidate
          set — no duplicate candidates are minted — and that evidence below a
          threshold is never reported as high confidence.  Nothing is
          auto-promoted to a PoC / new task pack / PR / install.

  WL-R07  Price-record identity normalization: model / provider / currency /
          effective_at / source / version are preserved; any missing item is
          stamped the sentinel ``UNKNOWN`` (never collapsed to 0 / ""), and an
          unknown amount is never rendered as a concrete zero.  Entitlement,
          subscription, API price, and real consumption are kept in separate
          lanes; the earlier (superseded) value keeps its validity window.
          The ``unknown_propagates`` flag lets the UI and any export carry the
          honest UNKNOWN instead of a fabricated number.

These functions are pure data transforms: they accept and return plain
dicts / lists, so they can be driven by fixtures with no radar_core import.
