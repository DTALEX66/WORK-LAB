"""Observation layer for the radar candidate chain (incremental sidecar).

Addresses the 2026-09-15 cloud-audit static findings on radar_core.py
WITHOUT rewriting the 17-field Candidate or the existing discover()
contract.  This module is a pure additive sidecar: radar_core.py is
untouched, so test_radar.py's hard contracts (17 fields, dedupe/sort,
honest-empty-source, deterministic receipt) stay byte-stable.

  F1 discover() first-writer-wins discards later price/license/version
     updates -> ObservationLedger.diff() keeps every original observation
     and emits new / superseded / conflict / removed relations instead of
     silently dropping the later one.
  F2 Candidate defaults (stars=0, surfaces=False) conflate UNKNOWN with
     CONFIRMED-FALSE -> Observation stores None (unknown) vs False
     (confirmed absent) distinctly; to_dict preserves the distinction.
  F3 StaticSourceAdapter.available() confuses "legitimately empty result"
     with "source unavailable" -> SourceReport carries an explicit
     fetch_status (FETCH_OK / FETCH_EMPTY / UNAVAILABLE / ERROR), plus
     coverage / items_count / last_success_at, decoupled from "has items".
  F4 Candidate has no structured price-validity / entitlement /
     standard-version / cross-project fit -> Observation carries a
     structured PriceRecord + entitlement + standard_version + fits
     sidecar (unknown stays unknown, never filled with 0).
  F5 min_stars + stars-desc sort does not generalise to models/papers/
     standards/plans -> rank_signal(entity_kind) routes the ranking signal.
