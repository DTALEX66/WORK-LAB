"""SkillSpector gate (WL-300 / ch 26): the 7-stage extension pipeline.

ch 26 mandates that every Skill / MCP / Hook / Plugin / Agent Package
pass through, in order::

    Source -> Canonical repo -> License -> Hash -> SkillSpector -> Sandbox -> Approval

WORK-LAB OWNS the pipeline (ch 41).  SkillSpector itself is an external
scanner (NVIDIA, Apache-2.0); by the ch 35 external-asset rule it is
NEVER vendored — it must first be registered in the Extension Registry
and approved before its stage can run.  A scanner that is not approved is
a fail-closed DENY at the SkillSpector stage, not a silent pass.  And the
final PASS authority is WORK-LAB's Approval stage, never the scanner's
own verdict (ch 41: "最终谁有资格宣布 PASS").
