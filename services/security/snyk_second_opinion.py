"""Snyk second opinion (WL-310 / ch 27).

Snyk Agent Scan is the *second* opinion on top of the SkillSpector gate
(ch 26).  ch 27's two load-bearing rules:

* an UNKNOWN MCP must run in an ISOLATED environment — never directly on
  the host;
* a third-party stdio MCP server must NOT be scanned by executing it on the
  host (a host-direct scan would run the very code under test, unsandboxed).

Snyk itself is an external tool; by ch 35 WORK-LAB never vendors it — it
holds only Snyk's verdict (a structured receipt) and cross-checks it
against the gate's own verdict.  The second opinion can AGREE, DISAGREE,
or be ABSENT (Snyk not available) — absence is honest, it does not
override the gate, it just says "no corroboration yet".
