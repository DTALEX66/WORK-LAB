"""The live open-task register, projected as ``taskRecords``.

Why this module exists (owner readback 2026-10-27: 「现在界面上登记记录的内容 都是假的啊 都给我接入进来啊 我要真实的啊」):
the Work lane's 任务记录 panel has been answering `0 条` because the ONLY source it read was
``canonical_store.tasks``, and that table is empty on this machine (measured 2026-10-27 against the live
store: tasks=0, execution_instances=0, ci_runs=0, usage_samples=0). The tasks that actually exist are
written by hand in `taskpacks/current/OPEN-TASK-REGISTER.md` — the single live open-task register named in
AGENTS.md's mandatory bootstrap — and until now no code in this repository parsed it at all, so 42 real
registrations reached nobody.

Discipline this module is built on:

* **one parser, not two.** Cell splitting and row judgement are imported from
  ``scripts/ci/verify_register_table_shape.py`` — the repository's existing authority for this exact table
  — through ``importlib`` rather than restated here. Two parsers over one register is how a second,
  disagreeing "truth" gets produced; the row count this module reports is additionally reconciled against
  ``scan()`` and a disagreement is an UNREADABLE state, never a quietly different number.
* **shape, not guess.** A table is accepted when its header names the four columns
  ``ID | Priority | Status | Work``. Column positions come from the header, never from an assumed index.
* **escapes are content.** ``\\|`` inside a cell is a pipe in the sentence, not a column boundary. Nine
  rows of this register were historically mis-read that way, and ``cells_of`` is what decides it.
* **verbatim mapping.** Status is the register's own string (``EXECUTED_20261009 / REAL``,
  ``PARTIAL_20261010 / …``). Translating it to 完成/进行中 would drop exactly the information the owner
  wrote. Priority and Work are the cells as written (minus the escape markers).
* **no invented columns.** The register has no timestamp column and no project column, so ``createdAt`` /
  ``updatedAt`` are null and ``projectId`` is the register's OWNER (this repository), never a per-row guess.
* **bounded, and the bound is disclosed.** Work cells are prose: measured 121,257 characters over the 42
  live rows, one cell alone 18,447. A read-only projection re-sent on every snapshot tick cannot carry
  that, so ``register.work`` is a verbatim PREFIX capped at ``WORK_EXCERPT_CHARS``, and every row also
  carries the cell's true length (``workChars``) and whether it was cut (``workTruncated``). A cap applied
  in silence is the same defect as a filter applied in silence.
* **unreadable is a state, not an empty list.** ``[]`` reads as "the register was queried and holds
  nothing"; the front already distinguishes the two, so a missing file, a file with no table, a header that
  is not the register's, a register with zero data rows, or a parser disagreement each yield exactly one
  record whose ``register.state`` is ``UNREADABLE`` and whose ``register.reason`` names the failure.
