"""Adapter capability projection: one card per managed client, seven layers per card (P1-03 / F1).

The blueprint's capability ladder (WORK-LAB-BLUEPRINT-20261006.md §6) names seven layers that are each a
different claim, and none of them proves the next one:

    Registered -> Installed -> Loaded/Connected -> Qualified -> Enabled for Task
                 -> Native Projection -> Observed in Execution

Before this module the ladder existed only in prose, so a UI could call a manifest entry "installed" or an
adapter "native verified". This module is the single place that decides a layer's state, and the rules that
keep it honest are:

* a layer is MET only from a named source that carries that layer's own evidence; anything else is
  NOT_PROBED with the reason that says what is missing — never blank, never inherited from the layer
  below, never promoted because a sibling succeeded;
* `INSTALLED` never follows from a version string. It follows only from a software install-identity row
  whose location status is RESOLVED (U17), and the card says which status it read;
* the registry's own `detection.evidence_state` is carried through unchanged. A version readback is not a
  package-hash check, so an UNVERIFIED declaration must not be laundered into a pass by projection;
* per-client facts come from `config/capability-matrix.json#clients[]` (status, write policy, risk,
  runtime adapter, config-ownership default). `config/capability-conformance.json` describes PROTOCOLS, so
  it is attached as protocol status and never renamed into a per-client capability list;
* where the registry and the matrix state different verb sets for the same client, both are shown and the
  drift is named. Choosing one as truth is an owner decision, not a projection's;
* the seven layers say what a CLIENT is (declared, installed, observed). They cannot say which verbs of the
  adapter interface it answers, so a card carries an orthogonal `verbEvidence` dimension — one row per verb,
  each either MET from a named read-only call, NOT_SUPPORTED from a named declaration, or NOT_PROBED with a
  concrete refusal reason. An honest NOT_PROBED outranks a fabricated MET: a verb row never promotes a
  layer, never moves `nativeStatus`, and an absent probe record emits NO rows at all rather than an empty
  list that would render as "declared to support nothing".
