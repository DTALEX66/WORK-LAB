"""Deploy global rules — sync the global boundaries to each software's rule file.

Authoritative reference: docs/decisions/global-execution-standard.md (global
boundaries). This tool maintains a hardcoded mirror of the four global
boundary rules (GLOBAL_BOUNDARIES below) and inserts/updates them into each
software's rule file via a managed block (marker-delimited), so a change to
the source is carried by hand into GLOBAL_BOUNDARIES and then propagated to
all targets. Idempotent.

Note: the path '.project/governance/global-execution-standard.md' no longer
exists (2026-09 directory convergence moved the global standard to
docs/decisions/); keep the authoritative text in docs/decisions/ and keep
GLOBAL_BOUNDARIES in sync with it manually.
