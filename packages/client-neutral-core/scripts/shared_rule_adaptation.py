"""NF-10-SYNC: shared rules / skills / user-difference real adaptation.

A shared user semantic must take effect in more than one software while
allowing assets to be added/removed WITHOUT clobbering the user's native
choices.  Reuses the config-ownership vocabulary (base / live / candidate
three-way compare) instead of inventing a second ownership model.

Key semantics (acceptance AT-02 / AT-30 / AT-36, self-executable slice)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Field layering** — rule definition / software adapter / user preference /
  project diff / task-local constraint are separate layers; a project diff must
  never pollute the global, and managed updates never rewrite model /
  provider / reasoning / auth / user-plugin values (the user's native choice).
* **Three-way compare keeps the user's modification** — base vs live vs
  candidate: a field the user changed in ``live`` is PRESERVED; an upstream
  (candidate) change is treated as *pending adaptation*, never a blind restore
  of the old snapshot.
* **Managed deletion removes only owned content** — removing a managed asset
  deletes ONLY the content it owns; add/delete/rollback never touch unknown
  fields.
* **Skills load on demand** — an asset is managed only if it has provenance;
  the current count (13) is inventory, not a permanent number.

Pure and deterministic: no global deploy, no provider / API-Key change, no
upstream internal file edit, no per-new-model skill copy.
