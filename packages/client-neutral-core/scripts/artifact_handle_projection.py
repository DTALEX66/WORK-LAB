"""Artifact handle projection: the list that was missing behind REQ-RANGE-20261007.

The read side already had a viewer: ``GET /api/v1/evidence-range`` returns an exact byte interval of one
evidence artifact plus a slice digest. What it never had was a list of things it may be asked to view, so
the record sat at ``UI_LANDING_BLOCKED_ON_HANDLE_PROJECTION``. This module supplies that list and nothing
more than the list: identity only, never content.

Why each row is shaped the way it is:

* **handle** — an absolute path produced under exactly the predicates ``evidence_range_reader.read_range``
  applies (absolute, inside the repository, on a declared evidence surface, a regular file, not
  credential-shaped). A projected handle is therefore a handle the range route will accept, which is the
  only claim this projection is qualified to make;
* **surface** — the boundary-declaration key the artifact sits on, so a reader can tell canonical evidence
  from transient runtime output without re-reading the declaration;
* **sizeBytes / modifiedAt** — from the directory listing, never from reading the file;
* **digest** — present only when some *project record* already states it (a manifest pair, a spill-ledger
  line, a Task Ledger evidence row). Nothing here hashes file content: ``read_range`` deliberately refuses
  to compute a whole-file digest because it would turn a cheap interval read into a full read, and a
  projection that copied that behaviour would read the entire evidence tree to build a list of paths.
  ``digestRecorded`` says positively that no digest exists, which is a fact, not a blank;
* **kind** — what a viewer would render it as, decided from the extension only.

Hard refusals (ERR-166 is the reason these exist and are not optional):
* credential-shaped names are refused by name even when they sit inside an evidence root — the token list
  is IMPORTED from ``evidence_range_reader`` so the two layers cannot drift apart;
* nothing outside the declared evidence surfaces is enumerated; the surfaces come from
  ``declared_evidence_roots()``, i.e. from ``project-data-boundary.json`` itself;
* file bytes never enter any field. This module opens only digest-BEARING RECORDS (bounded count and size),
  and indexes their stated digests, never their prose.

Cost discipline, because this runs inside the read path (twice per snapshot: the live-gate skeleton and the
snapshot itself): the canonical evidence surface is walked completely (measured 1.3k files, ~27 ms) and the
runtime surface is walked to a declared depth with regenerable trees pruned (~2.9k files, ~60 ms). Anything
that did not reach the snapshot is declared in ``artifactHandlesSummary`` — an enumeration can be capped,
it can never be quietly capped.
