"""NF-12-SYNC: software / model / protocol updates adapt only the affected surface.

After a version change the handoff must still work — without freezing the old
version, without binding to one model, and without reinstalling every piece of
software.  A version / capability change triggers ONLY the affected adaptation;
the other clients are not reinstalled.  No change is a legal NO_CHANGE.

Key semantics (acceptance AT-36 / AT-37, self-executable slice)
----------------------------------------------------------------
* **Snapshot then diff** — record the real runtime / protocol / capability
  snapshot; an update checks ONLY the fields, skills, plugins and
  input/output + cancel/resume interfaces it actually uses.
* **NO_CHANGE is legal** — if the target capability did not change, the result
  is NO_CHANGE, not an "enlarged file count" claim.
* **Minimal patch only on incompatibility** — an incompatibility produces the
  smallest patch + a rollback plan, not a whole-package reinstall.
* **Shared adapter upgrade keeps old handoffs readable** — after two projects
  share an adapter and it upgrades, a pre-upgrade handoff message is still
  readable; an unknown cost stays UNKNOWN.
* **Model params are the user's native choice** — only support and necessary
  context are checked, never a forced max-reasoning / new model.
* **Failure isolation** — one maintenance window not approved does not
  cascade into a whole-package failure.

Pure and deterministic: no real venv / plugin update, no forced user model
choice, no paid call.
