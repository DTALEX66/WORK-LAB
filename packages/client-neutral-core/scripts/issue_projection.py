"""Issue center: problems derived from facts the store already holds (audit 2026-10-22 §闭环距离 row 2).

The repo had counts (collector delivery/refusal totals, coverage numerators) and task statuses, but no place
that said "these are the problems, which project and software each belongs to, how often it has been seen,
and what evidence backs it". A reader could see `refused_rows=4824` and still not know what is wrong. This
module turns those already-recorded facts into issue rows. It never re-reads a source and never infers a
cause: every row names the table and key it came from.

Three invariants, each enforced by a test rather than by intent:

* **absent is not empty.** A source that could not be read yields no rows and a named source state; a source
  read that holds nothing yields the empty count. Collapsing the two would claim "no problems on this
  machine", which is the opposite statement, and the repo has convicted that shape before (ERR-256 lineage).
* **dedup by identity, not by string equality.** The fingerprint hashes a declared tuple
  (class, project, subject) so the same condition recurring across polls folds into one issue with an
  occurrence count, and a different class on the same subject stays a different issue.
* **priority is a rule table.** Every severity comes from a named rule that is listed in the row itself, so
  a card can say "why is this P1" instead of a reader guessing which number produced it.
