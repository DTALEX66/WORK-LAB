"""NF-14-SYNC: layered delivery, the universal goal must be genuinely signed
off.

Deliver a single usable single-link result FIRST, then complete the universal
proof; intermediate results carry a distinct name and never silently become
the final goal.  The final label ``UNIVERSAL_WORKFLOW_VERIFIED`` is used ONLY
when the universal validation matrix is met by real evidence.  When a real
external project or a second executor is missing, the delivery may report a
STAGE COMPLETE — it must NOT be claimed as a full completion.  An uninstalled
software is never given a fake LIVE PASS; a condition-study / unrelated
maintenance gap is preserved, but it does not drag an in-scope delivery into
an unbounded re-audit loop.

Reuses the evidence-level vocabulary from NF-02 (``acceptance_evidence``) —
simulation and real evidence are graded separately, never summed.

Pure and deterministic: no publish / merge / deploy (those are independent
side effects, blocked here), no fake LIVE PASS, no infinite audit loop.
