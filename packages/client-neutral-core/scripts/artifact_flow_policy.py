"""NF-01 rule semantic: what may legally transfer vs. what stays forbidden.

Clarifies the broad root-rule phrasing ("inside the project Git root" and
"no prompt/response bodies") WITHOUT weakening the data boundary:

  * A *user-published business artifact* (audit / task document the user
    explicitly selected to ship, or an immutable task-package / receipt
    reference) may flow to an authorized target material space.
  * *Private session libraries, native conversation logs, telemetry bodies
    and credentials* are NEVER auto-mirrored.  Telemetry keeps only
    references + minimal metadata.
  * A project's *temporary* offline / model preference is scoped to that
    project (or a task) and never becomes a global forcing on another
    project.

Pure and deterministic: no filesystem, no network, no native private store
is read.  Every decision carries its reason so callers fail-closed on the
sensitive path while non-sensitive work keeps moving.  Unknown artifact
kinds are never silently allowed.
