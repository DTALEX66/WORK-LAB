"""Active project detection (workspace-discovery mode).

Scans the user's total workspace root for Git projects and detects which ones
are currently being executed by workflow agents (Hermes / Codex / CC Switch).
This is the bridge between "user-specified workspace" and the Observer
projection: projects that are loaded/executed by a workflow agent get an
`active` status in the canonical registry, so the Observer can show a truthful
"what is being worked on right now" view.

Security boundaries:
- Read-only process inspection: tasklist/wmic command lines are read to match
  a process working directory against a known project root; we never read
  credentials, sessions, prompt bodies or response bodies.
- Only projects under the user-specified workspace root are considered.
- The detector writes only canonical registry metadata (project status),
  never project content.
