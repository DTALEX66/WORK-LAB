"""Path containment decided from text, so one input gives one answer on every host.

This module is the single home of the rule that has now produced three CI refutations in one day when it
was applied inconsistently:

* `os.path.normpath`/`normcase` and `Path.resolve()` are host-specific. On the Linux runner a Windows-shaped
  path has neither a drive nor a leading slash, so posixpath reads it as RELATIVE and anchors it inside
  the current project -- which is how the same boundary assertions were ACCEPTED on one machine and
  REFUSED on another.
* Case-folding is correct for COMPARISON and wrong for OPENING a file: a folded path simply does not exist
  on a case-sensitive filesystem, and `Path.relative_to` between a folded value and an original-case root
  raises `ValueError`, which a `try/except` reading "not ours to read" turns into a security refusal.

So callers get two distinct operations: `inside_root` / `relative_inside` for the verdict, and the
declared-case remainder for any subsequent I/O. Nothing here touches the filesystem.
