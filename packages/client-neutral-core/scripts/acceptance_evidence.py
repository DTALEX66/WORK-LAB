"""NF-02-SYNC: real cross-process / cross-project acceptance + exact-version CI.

The acceptance slice separates EVIDENCE LEVELS so a universal delivery is not
accepted on simulation counts or a same-object repeat or a plain green light:

  * every claimed-supported acceptance case (AT) must carry a REAL or
    appropriate-level piece of evidence; SIMULATION and REAL evidence are
    counted SEPARATELY and never summed;
  * at least one EXTERNAL real project is used WITHOUT copying the core source
    into it; project-role switching does not cross-wire;
  * a CI gate is tied to an EXACT SHA — it is not substituted by a
    different-SHA CI success, and a public repository is never wired to an
    arbitrary PR-callable everyday self-hosted runner;
  * an optional/mature-solution comparison must not block the required gate;
  * without the matching authorization a case stays PENDING-VERIFY, it is NOT
    faked as a pass.

Pure and deterministic: no network, no CI invocation, no runner, no real
device; this module only grades evidence and validates the gate policy.
