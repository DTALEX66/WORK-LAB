"""NF-11-SYNC: thin deployment, existing-module reuse and exit paths.

Shared capability is installed and maintained ONCE; a project only
CONFIGURES it.  When an enhancement is uninstalled, the native software still
works standalone.  Guarantees (AT-29 / AT-30 / AT-40, self-executable slice):

* **Thin** — adding a project adds ONLY its config + local state: no new
  core-source copy, no new daemon / scheduler, no resident LLM polling.
* **Reuse, not duplication** — receiving / returning is hooked into the
  EXISTING run lifecycle; a reused component hands over its call site, tests
  and the substitution point (a *candidate registration* is not the same as
  adoption).
* **Exit paths** — pause sync, revoke one project's binding, roll back an
  adapter version and remove a managed asset, WITHOUT affecting native tasks;
  un-returned records are PRESERVED, not deleted.
* **No relocation of native data** — project-local run data lands where the
  project declared it; an official software HOME and an active library are
  never moved; different projects do not copy code / venv into each other.
* **No four task cores** — no n8n / Linear / Vibe Kanban / Symphony
  task-core stack is layered on.

Pure and deterministic: no install, no launch, no global asset change.
