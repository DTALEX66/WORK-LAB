"""Producers for the WUI-21 read models: operation progress and isolated trial.

The owner's pack (§5, scenes 05/06) names five stages — 未开始 → 提交中 → 排队/运行 → 通过/失败/取消/未知,
with 超时 = 未知或超时 — and this module is the server-side answer to how much of that this repository can
actually say. The mapping is deliberately narrow and each unmapped name becomes a declared gap:

* ``task_ledger.py:15`` holds the real state set (QUEUED, PLANNING, WAITING_APPROVAL, RUNNING, RETRYING,
  PAUSED, BLOCKED, REVIEWING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED). The pack's stages that exist there are mapped;
  everything else the pack asks for is carried in ``producer_gaps``.
* **There is no SUBMITTING state**, because nothing records the client-to-ledger handoff. A page that showed
  "submitting" would be inventing a stage from latency, so the gap is named instead.
* **Timeout is not failure.** `TaskLedger.detect_zombie` says the lease stopped being renewed: the observation
  went stale. That yields ``UNKNOWN_OR_TIMEOUT``. Turning it into FAILED would tell the owner the operation
  broke when the only fact is that we stopped being able to see it (the same rule ERR-222 records for
  disconnects, one level up).
* **The three results stay three.** ``build_isolated_trial`` reports write, native read-back and target
  behaviour as separate status+basis objects. A COMPLETED child answers the write stage only;
  `target_behaviour` is answered solely from a reconciled external effect
  (`task_ledger.py:21`, EXTERNAL_EFFECT_STATES), which is why a source-side success can never light it.
