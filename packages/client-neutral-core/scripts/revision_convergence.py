"""NF-08-E: revision / cancellation / out-of-order / unknown-effect convergence.

When a user adjusts requirements across software, the OLD revision must not
resurrect or clobber the new one, and a cancellation plus already-happened /
still-unknown effects are handled honestly.  Reuses the revision-chain /
late-result semantics already defined by ``handoff_envelope.RevisionRegistry``
and the task-ledger transition + external-effect vocabulary — no second
convergence model.

Key semantics (acceptance AT-25/26/27/28)
------------------------------------------
* **Late completion of a lower revision never ends a higher one** — rev1 is
  still running when rev2 is published; rev1's late result is held for audit,
  it does not close rev2 or advance the active revision.
* **After cancellation, no new effect is started** — a task transitioned to
  CANCELLED (a terminal state) refuses any new external-effect claim;
  already-CONFIRMED or still-PENDING (unknown) effects remain queryable.
* **Unknown effects are not blindly retried** — an effect in the UNKNOWN state
  is reconciled against evidence first; a blind retry is refused.  The
  rejection is scoped to the AFFECTED task only, not a global halt.
