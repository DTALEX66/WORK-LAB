"""NF-05-SYNC: client capabilities registered BY ROLE, reusing native probes.

The goal is "the same task format faces different software; adding software
is mainly a thin adapter, not a change to every project".  This module
registers capability ROLES against software, with capabilities driven by
*probes* — a capability is declared ONLY if the probe confirmed it.  The
capability vocabulary is deliberately NOT a fixed seven-item enum: it is a
dynamic table per software, so a software that only supports task-visibility
/ artifact import is PARTIAL, not falsely reported as full-feature.

Key semantics (acceptance AT-18/19/20)
---------------------------------------
* **Roles** separate planning/publishing, execution, review, storage and
  observation.  A planning / review software (e.g. a GitHub or CC Switch
  integration) is registered under its real role and is never presented as a
  code executor.
* **Probe-driven capabilities** — a software's capability set is whatever its
  probe confirmed (read/publish/execute/status/cancel/resume/observe/...), not
  a hardcoded list.  Unsupported capabilities are simply absent and reported
  as PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED with the prerequisite that would close the gap.
* **Project-neutral adapter reuse** — the SAME adapter id is referenced by two
  projects; dispatch keys on the adapter id, never on a project name.
* **Decoupling** — removing one executor (e.g. Hermes) leaves the others
  usable; executor selection is by *capability*, not by a fixed dependency on
  any one software.

Pure and deterministic: no network, no process launch, no paid call, no
credential access.
