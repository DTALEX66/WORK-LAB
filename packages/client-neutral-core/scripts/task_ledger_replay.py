"""Task Ledger replay + side-effect consistency harness (NX-410).

Deterministic state transition replay harness. Simulates 8 failure classes and
proves that external side effects are never duplicated and the writer is never
blocked on CI/network waits.

Failure classes:
1. process crash mid-run
2. old writer revival (stale fence)
3. push result unknown
4. CI no job for 4h
5. rate limiting
6. duplicate webhook
7. task-definition upgrade
8. partially corrupted events

Guarantees (acceptance):
- Never repeats external side effects.
- Never holds the writer while waiting on CI/network.
- Old-version tasks are readable or explicitly migrated, never silently mis-run.
