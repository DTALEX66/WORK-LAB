"""NF-09-SYNC: multi-project task projection + run-evidence visibility.

Extend the EXISTING read-only Observer projection (``WorkflowProjectionAdapter``)
so the user can see, per project, which step a task is at, which software is
executing it, and who is waiting on whom — without entering duplicated chat
UIs.  The Observer STAYS READ-ONLY: publish / approve / cancel entry points stay
in the native client or a link, and NO write button is added to the sidecar GET
channel.

Key semantics (acceptance AT-24 / AT-34 / AT-38, self-executable slice)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Project filtering + stage state** — each project's tasks are shown with
  source/target software, material version, and the delivery / execution /
  return / review stage state, so project A and B are viewable independently.
* **Honest value display** — permission-insufficient, actual-zero, unknown,
  stale and online are shown as distinct labels; the update time comes from the
  FACT, not a UI refresh.  A task that ran but has not been returned is NEVER
  shown as "all failed" or "cloud received".
* **Stale marking** — after a client disconnects, its snapshot is marked STALE.
  An unknown value is never back-filled with 0.
* **Cost grouping** — cost is grouped by task and call source; subscription
  usage is NOT inferred into an "API billed amount".
* **No leakage** — another project's title or body is never exposed; a shared
  UI shows only the authorized-visible coarse state.
* **Read-only invariant** — the projection adds no write capability to the
  Observer (task / config / telemetry).

Pure and deterministic: no network, no Observer write, no leaked body.
