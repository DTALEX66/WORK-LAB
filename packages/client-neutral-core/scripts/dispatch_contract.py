"""NF-08-C: dispatch-to-execution contract (stop at handoff simulation -> real).

Design layer for "the first genuine closed loop: a planner publishes, a local
native executor claims, and a verifiable artifact is produced with ZERO manual
body copies".  Real native launch / model calls stay authorization-gated and
BLOCKED; this module defines the dispatch *contract* and the failure-layer
attribution so the slice is testable without a live executor.

Key semantics (acceptance AT-11 / AT-18 / AT-21)
-------------------------------------------------
* **Freeze before dispatch** — task / revision / baseline / executor /
  authorization reference are frozen and the local workspace resolved; a dirty
  local worktree is NEVER auto-pull / auto-reset.
* **Real launch intent** — pre-launch intent, the REAL run/session id and the
  actual instruction source are recorded (no global ``--last`` guesswork).
* **Risk ordering** — a low-risk deterministic native task runs first; the
  minimal Agent task only under an existing cost grant; a fake executor is
  contract evidence only.
* **Executor handoff** — switching executor for the same task first confirms
  the old runtime has completed / safely paused; only the REMAINING work is
  handed over, never the whole package again.
* **Failure-layer attribution** — a startup failure is attributed to exactly
  one layer (transport / permission / runtime / model); other projects keep
  running.  A command returning 0 or a model saying DONE is NOT full
  acceptance.
