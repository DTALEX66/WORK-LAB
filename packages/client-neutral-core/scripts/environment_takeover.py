"""NF-08-I: multi-environment routing and controlled takeover.

Different computers / cloud nodes can join; a task has exactly ONE valid
dispatcher.  An offline takeover must not create a double writer.  Guarantees
(AT-15 / AT-16 / AT-35, self-executable slice):

  * the same project / task / revision is obtained even though the LOCAL PATHS
    differ across environments (binding is per-environment; identity is
    path-independent);
  * after a takeover, an old node coming back online does NOT re-dispatch the
    old task; if the old run state cannot be confirmed the state stays an
    explicit BLOCK, not a silent re-dispatch;
  * a dual-device takeover declaration requires evidence from two REAL
    environments — a simulation only counts as a test, never as proof.

Reuses the per-project root binding from NF-03 and the lease/fence
single-dispatch primitive from the task ledger.  No shared-folder arbitration,
no Redis/Kafka/Kubernetes added for generality, no auto-shutdown of the user's
other software.

Pure and deterministic: no network, no real node join, no credentials.
