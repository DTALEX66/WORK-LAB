"""NF-08-F: one on-demand entry point per software, minimal manual operation.

A single set of UNIFIED verbs (publish / view / resume / adjust / return) is
routed to each host's NATIVE entry point, so the user does not have to remember
directories or per-software commands.  Two different hosts work without copying
the task body; one of them does not depend on Hermes.  Inside a clearly
authorized scope the same confirmation is not re-asked per card; only a NEW
outbound/write triggers the corresponding authorization.  A standard resume
loads only the context the task needs — never every project history or the full
skill texts.

Pure routing / policy layer: no network, no host process launch, no credential
access.  The native entry points are referenced symbolically and bound by the
host adapter; they are not executed here.
