"""NF-03-SYNC: config-driven project registration + local path binding.

Extends the existing ProductProject / registry surfaces WITHOUT a new project
model.  The goal is: a new project is onboarded by *declaration + local
binding only* — Git, multi-repo, plain-folder and document-based projects all
work; identity is a stable opaque ``project_id`` (never three names, a Git
remote string, or a single drive letter); and a cloud task may NOT carry its
own absolute local path to re-point at another project.

Pure and deterministic: no filesystem, no Git, no network.  Machine roots are
an in-memory user overlay (never committed to Git), mirroring the existing
``project_identity_resolver.machine_roots`` design.  Default-deny: a project
that is not on-boarded cannot be scanned or executed.
