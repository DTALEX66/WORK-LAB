"""Minimal cross-software task handoff primitive (integrated-taskpack NF-08).

Reuses the existing Task Ledger semantics and adds only the *gap set* NF-08
calls out — the scenarios the 8 single-writer replay classes do NOT cover in a
cross-execution-entry handoff:

  1. response-lost: the receiving entry never confirms; the SAME delivery id
     is re-sent and must be idempotent (no duplicate side effect).
  2. restart-duplicate: after a restart the same task is delivered twice to
     one entry; only the first is a real effect.
  3. produce-after-cancel: a task already in a terminal state (CANCELLED /
     COMPLETED / FAILED) must NOT produce a new side effect.
  4. external-effect-unknown: an effect whose external outcome is unknown is
     reconciled (observed absent/unknown) and is NOT blindly retried.

The payload is desensitized: only the handoff whitelist travels (repo / head /
task / goal / verified / next / permission scope).  Credentials and raw
conversation are dropped by construction.  Everything here is pure and
deterministic — no real network, no native private database, no paid calls,
and it never claims exactly-once (it claims idempotency + fail-closed).
