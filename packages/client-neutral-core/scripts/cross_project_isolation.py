"""NF-08-H: cross-project collaboration reference and isolation.

One capability may serve many ISOLATED projects, and — where both sides hold
valid in-scope authorization — an authorized A→B artifact delivery can
complete.  A project NAME is not an authorization.  The guarantees:

  * A's network failure, A's rule change, and A's task cancellation never
    affect independent B (independent namespaces / roots).
  * An authorized A→B delivery completes; an UNAUTHORIZED reference must NOT
    cross B's read boundary — it is refused, not silently exposed.
  * Cross-project association shows ONLY the authorized-visible state; a shared
    UI does not leak another project's summary.

Reuses the per-project root isolation established by ``project_binding_registry``
(one TaskLedger root per project) and the NF-08-0 authorization-reference
semantics (a grant record, not a name, is the only authority).  No second
collaboration model.

Pure and deterministic: no network, no cross-project write, no credential
access; isolation is proven by operating on independent in-memory roots.
