"""Throwaway fixture roots that cannot land outside the project Git root.

ERR-140 was a bare ``tempfile.mkdtemp()`` in a governance test: its ``tearDown`` did
``shutil.rmtree(..., ignore_errors=True)``, so a failing run left complete mirrors of the authority
package in the system temp directory — outside the boundary
``.project/governance/project-data-boundary.json`` declares ("all content this project produces —
builds, caches, temp files, evidence … stays locked inside the project Git root").

The canonical gate runner binds ``TMP``/``TEMP``/``TMPDIR`` to ``.project-local/runs/tmp`` for its
children, so a fixture created *inside a gate run* is already contained. This module removes the
dependence on that environment for paths production code creates when it is invoked directly, and it
deliberately exposes one entry point named ``fixture_dir`` rather than ``mkdtemp``: the debt gate
``tests/workflow-assistance/test_temp_fixture_stays_inside_the_boundary.py`` fails on any call whose
name is ``mkdtemp`` without ``dir=``, so a bounded helper must not be able to masquerade as the leak it
replaces.

The other half is release. ``git`` writes ``.git/objects/xx/*`` with mode 0444, so a plain
``shutil.rmtree`` of a fixture that ran ``git commit`` stops with WinError 5 on Windows, and
``ignore_errors=True`` hid that completely: measured 2026-10-08, ``.project-local/runs/tmp`` held 4811
leftover fixture roots / 531.7 MiB, 676 of them still containing a nested ``.git``. ``force_release``
below is the one implementation that clears the read-only bits before deleting, and every fixture
release goes through it.

That still leaves orphans: the at-exit sweep only knows about the fixtures *this* process created, so a
run that is killed, times out or crashes leaves its roots behind with no owner. Nothing reclaimed them
until ``scripts/maintenance/release_temp_fixture_residue.py``, and the bound gate
``tests/ci/test_temp_fixture_residue_is_bounded.py`` now refuses to let that pile up again.
