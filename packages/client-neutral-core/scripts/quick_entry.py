"""Quick Entry: the thin unified entry's request handling, per blueprint §15.2.

Coverage item OD05 in `.project/governance/blueprint-coverage.json` said, verbatim: "SOURCE_GAP: Lite, tray
HUD and Quick Entry have no field or permission spec anywhere in the source ... must not be presented as
implemented modes". This module plus `packages/contracts/schemas/workflow/quick-entry-request.schema.json`
is the field and permission spec, and §15.2's five release conditions are the outcomes below -- each one is
judged from the request, never from a caller's assertion about the world.

It is also the first non-test consumer of `context_bundle.ContextBundle`: an accepted entry assembles the
bundle the executors are meant to receive, so the assembly path is exercised by a real caller rather than
only by its own tests.

No authentication, token, or credential surface exists here and none may be added: `permission.mode` is the
operation's declared capability (observe / propose / execute), the same vocabulary the ownership contracts
already use, and a refusal is a normal returned outcome rather than an exception.
