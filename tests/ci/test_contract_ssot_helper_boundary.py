"""The contract-SSOT helper boundary must be able to go red in both directions.

`verify_contract_ssot.py` used to print unlisted schema files as `[advisory]` and still exit 0, so the
only way to trust the new rule is to plant both faults it exists to catch. Nothing here writes to the
tree: the verdict is computed from synthetic path sets, and one assertion runs the real command over the
real tree so the declared set cannot drift from reality by accident.
