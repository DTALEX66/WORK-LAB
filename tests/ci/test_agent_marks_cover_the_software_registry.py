"""Every software the registry knows about must have a mark, and every category it uses must be decided.

Why this is a source sweep in Python rather than a browser assertion: the population is
`config/software-registry.json`, and the thing being checked is coverage of a declaration -- the front end
can only render what the snapshot hands it, so a test that mounts components can never notice a software id
that nobody drew a glyph for. That is the same blind spot that let CL-15 report "brand applied" while the
surface the desktop window shows had none.

The category tripwire is the important half. `agent-runtime` and `agent-harness` are monitored agents;
`platform`, `provider-switch` and `design-client` are not. A category the file has never seen must fail
here, because the alternative is that a new kind of software is silently drawn into the agent HUD -- or
silently dropped from it -- by whichever list happens to be shorter.
