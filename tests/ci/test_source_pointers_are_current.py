"""Line pointers into fast-moving source must be re-derived mechanically, not re-measured by hand.

Measured over two days: four separate CI failures came from `path:LINE` citations pointing at a blank line or
at unrelated code after someone edited the file above them. Every repair was manual -- read the gate's message,
guess the new number, push, fail one line off -- which is why the same failure kept coming back under a new
number. This module pins the mechanical path instead:

* `scripts/ci/repoint_source_pointers.py` re-derives each pointer from the code it quotes (`--apply`), so a
  repair is one command rather than a guess;
* this gate runs it in check mode, so the next drift is a red line WITH the command that fixes it.

What it deliberately does NOT require: `UNRESOLVED` (a fragment quote whose target is genuinely ambiguous) and
`NARRATIVE` (a bare number in prose, which the pack's own matrix gate already tests for "not a blank line").
Failing on those would push editors to delete citations to make the gate green -- the opposite of the point.
