"""A directory-shaped `git check-ignore` probe proves nothing, and this repo must not reason with it.

Measured on this checkout: `git check-ignore -v --no-index services/` exits 0 and names `.gitignore:44`,
which is an EMPTY line, and it does the same for `docs/current/` and for `totally-made-up-dir/`. Git
answers a trailing-slash query by matching the blank line, so the verdict is independent of the tree. The
same query with a file inside the directory is honest: `services/orchestration/sidecar.py` exits 1 while
`.project-local/runs/x.json` exits 0.

Why this is pinned: a claim that some build-output directory "is not ignored, so it can be committed by
accident" was nearly written on the strength of a directory-shaped probe, and the register cites ignore
status for several surfaces. Asking about a file is the only form that discriminates.
