"""Unit tests for the pressed-state motion gate — the instrument, not the browser.

This gate had no test file at all, which is how it could go red on a CI runner (PR #220's `observer` job)
for a reason that had nothing to do with the product: `CSS.forcePseudoState` starts an 80ms transition, and
one computed-style read taken right after the force can land on the transition's FIRST frame
(`matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)`) instead of its end state (`matrix(0.99, ...)`). The runner read the frame and
convicted a correct render; the same command on the development host settles at 0.99.

These cases pin the two things that make that reading honest now: the sampler waits for the paint to stop
moving, and a value that is neither the untouched paint nor the token's end state is reported as
UNMEASURABLE rather than as a product failure.
