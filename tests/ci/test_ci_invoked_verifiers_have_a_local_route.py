"""Gate: every verifier CI runs must have a local route, and this file is that route for eight of them.

The class of defect: `scripts/ci/verify_blueprint_coverage.py` ran only in the integration job, so the
branch was red at two pushed heads while the canonical local gate printed PASS on the same tree. A rule
a writer cannot run is a rule that honest edits break. This module is discovered by the root governance
batch, so the checks below now run in every local `verify` as well as in CI.

Two assertions, deliberately separated:
  REACHABLE  -- scripts/ci/verify_ci_check_reachability.py must say no CI-only rule survived;
  VERIFIED   -- each named verifier is actually executed here and must exit 0 on its own verdict line.

The generated TypeScript projection is checked by regenerating and comparing, then restoring the
committed bytes: the committed file is the evidence, so a test that left a mutation behind would be
reporting on its own side effect.
