"""A shipped derived projection must equal what the tree measures today, not what it measured once.

This repository has been bitten by the ordering before (ERR-151: an inventory digest taken before `git add`;
ERR-161: a receipt that stamped the head at write time). Measured again 2026-10-08: commit 7b5a4502 shipped
two derived artifacts that contradicted its own tree. Reproduced by running this module inside a detached
worktree at that commit -- 2 failures:

* `docs/audits/LEDGER_REGRESSION_COMMAND_TARGETS_2026-10-07.json` published the operand
  `reports/audit-archive` as GONE, but that same commit added `reports/audit-archive/FROZEN-MANIFEST.json`,
  which makes it DIR_NOT_FILE (a tracked directory is not a file promise). The artifact had been measured
  before those bytes were staged.
* `docs/audits/TOOL_INVENTORY_2026-10-07.json` published 5 citing surfaces for
  `scripts/audit/generate_frozen_surface_manifest.py` where that same commit's tree yields 6. The missing
  citation is the inventory itself: it scans its own file, so the first publication of a newly added tool is
  stale by exactly that self-citation and only converges once the artifact is republished. The freshness
  check is what forces that second publish inside the same commit; excluding the self-citation is the owed
  alternative (ERR-222).

The canonical gate came back green at that head (.project-local/runs/gate-frozen/gate-verify-7b5a4502.log),
so nothing in the suite could tell a current measurement from a file that once said OK.

These tests are that missing check. Each generator runs once per module, into a temporary directory, and the
result is compared against the committed bytes -- ignoring only the fields that name the moment of
measurement. A red here means the committed artifact is stale; it cannot mean the tree moved under the test,
because a separate assertion proves the redirected runs never touched the repository.
