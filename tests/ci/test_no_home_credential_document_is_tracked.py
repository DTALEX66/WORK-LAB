"""No home-owned credential-class document may sit in the tracked tree of a PUBLIC repository.

The project rule is explicit -- never commit credentials, `.env` files or auth stores -- and the
2026-09-30 audit archive import carried `reports/audit-archive/20260930/hermes/config.yaml`, a copy
of the user's live Hermes Home config, into a repository whose GitHub visibility is PUBLIC. A
value-shape scan of that file found zero secret-shaped values, so nothing was leaked *as measured*;
what was leaked is the config document itself, which AGENTS.md treats as mixed-ownership and
never-promotable. That is the exposure this test refuses to let grow again.

Two separate judgements are pinned here, because conflating them is how a false alarm and a real
leak both get waved through:
  * NAME class -- a tracked path whose exact basename is a credential/config-store kind. These must
    equal the declared exception set exactly, so a stale exception fails as loudly as a new one.
  * VALUE class -- secret-shaped bytes inside a tracked blob. The scanner that answers this is
    probed against planted shapes, because a zero-count instrument that has never been shown to
    fire proves nothing.
