"""The reference-resolution rule must be able to go red, and must not pass on an empty scan.

The rule exists because the authority index sent readers to two directories that have not existed since
the 2026-09 convergence, and because the README's normative 仓库结构 block advertised `bin/`, `skills/`
and `scripts/workflow/` as repository directories. Resolution is against `git ls-files` rather than the
filesystem, so these assertions plant tracked-path sets instead of touching disk -- which is also why the
verdict cannot depend on what a particular machine has in `.project-local/`.
