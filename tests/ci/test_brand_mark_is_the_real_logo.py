"""Gate: the brand mark in the shell is the real cut-out logo, at its own ratio, and it can actually glow.

No node on this machine means `vite build` and the vitest suite cannot run here, so this gate checks what is
decidable from the files themselves -- and it is strict about the three ways this change could have looked
right and rendered wrong:

  * the mask URL points at a file that exists in the repository (a described-but-absent asset builds fine
    and shows nothing);
  * each slot's width/height ratio matches the artwork's measured 1.9033:1, because `contain` hides a wrong
    box by letterboxing it silently -- the mark just gets smaller and nobody notices;
  * the glow lives on the *unmasked* element and the glyph on its ::before. Per CSS painting order a mask is
    applied after a filter, so `filter: drop-shadow()` written on the same rule as `mask:` glows the glyph
    and then clips the halo away. My first draft did exactly that; the control below is why the rule exists.

It also pins the decision this had to route around: `b10.css` is the pinned skin and stays verbatim (D-11),
so the rail override must live in the shell layer with two classes.
