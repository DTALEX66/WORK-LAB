"""Gate: the handle-latency instrument must be able to say "I did not measure that".

`scripts/audit/handle_block_visibility_via_cdp.py` spent a round reporting a 3,225 ms median for the
artifact-handle block that was entirely its own `sleep()`: the poll began ~3.2 s after navigation, so the
first DOM look already found the rows and the number described the instrument's wake-up time. The convergence
report repeated that figure as "the 3.26 s is almost all page-side" until a clean re-measurement put the same
page's rows at ~208 ms (`.project-local/artifacts/wl02-and-handle-20261021/handle-latency-attribution-v2.json`).

So the assertions here are not about the page being fast. They are about the instrument never again turning a
missing measurement into a number:

* a segment that is absent or negative is convicted by name, because a negative commit segment is exactly
  what mis-paired boundaries produced during this fix;
* the recorded moment must PREDATE the read-back, which is the shape of the original bug;
* "visible" is decided from the rows element's own rect, and a below-the-fold commit that reports a 0 ms
  scroll segment is a contradiction;
* a receipt that names no bundle bytes cannot be quoted for any build;
* the segment names the guard checks are read out of the instrument's own READBACK text, so renaming one on
  the page side without updating the verdict is convicted here rather than silently unchecked.
