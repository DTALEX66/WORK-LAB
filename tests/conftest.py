"""Pytest bootstrap: expose the converged module layout to all tests.

After the WL-DIR migration the workflow modules moved out of
the legacy numbered layout into domain directories
(services/*, packages/client-neutral-core/scripts, integrations/executors/*).
Legacy test files still insert ``ROOT / "scripts/workflow"``; this conftest
adds the real module roots so their imports resolve without editing 100+ files.
