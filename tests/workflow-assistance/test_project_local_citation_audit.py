"""Gate: a tracked document may not cite an absent `.project-local` evidence path without a disposition.

The auditable claim is not "how many absent paths are there" (that number is an artefact of the
scanner's scope: 28 from one pass, 200 tokens from a full-tree pass). It is the narrower one this
gate protects — every path that survives classification as a possible unavailable-evidence claim
must carry a hand-written disposition, so a reader is never sent to bytes that are not there.

Negative controls feed the classifier the exact sentence shapes that shipped so its buckets cannot
rot: an instruction to create a file must not be confused with a claim that the file is evidence.
