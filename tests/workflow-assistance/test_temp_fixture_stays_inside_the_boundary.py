"""Gate: a throwaway fixture directory must not be created outside the project boundary.

ERR-140: `tests/ci/test_project_authority_reference.py` built its copy of the live authority package
with a bare `tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="auth-ref-")`. `tearDown` did call `shutil.rmtree(...,
ignore_errors=True)`, and on this machine that swallow let nineteen complete mirrors of
`WORK-LAB-AUTHORITY.md`, both authority indexes, the open-task register, the error ledger and the
current taskcards sit in `%TEMP%` — 304 files / 7,126,653 bytes of governance material outside the
Git root, which `.project/governance/project-data-boundary.json` forbids ("all content this project
produces — builds, caches, temp files, evidence … stays locked inside the project Git root"). The
residue was released by `scripts/maintenance/release_authority_reference_temp_residue.py` after a
per-file manifest and an archive of the contents that differed from the live tree; the root cause is
the `dir=` argument this gate now enforces for its own file.

`mkdtemp` is the target because it leaks unless someone remembers to remove it.
`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` deletes itself on context exit, so 300+ of those are not the defect
class here and are deliberately out of scope.

Matching is done on the syntax tree, not on line text: the docstring of the fixed file *mentions*
`mkdtemp(prefix="auth-ref-")`, and a textual matcher reports prose as a violation.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
