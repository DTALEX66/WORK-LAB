"""Gate: the declared toolchains must be the toolchains the repository actually uses.

U02's path convergence was recorded as done for the entry documents while the project's package
managers, pins and runtime root had never been stated anywhere a machine could check them. This file
asserts each line of `.project/governance/toolchain-declarations.json` against the tree: a lockfile
that is declared must exist and be tracked; the Python pin must be readable from the workflow YAML;
a null pin must still be true (no setup-node step); the runtime root must be read from the boundary
file rather than restated from memory.

Deliberately NOT asserted: any Node or Rust version. Nothing in the repository pins them, so the
only honest value is `null` plus the recorded gap — writing a version here would be the fabricated
baseline this project has repeatedly refused.
