"""Gate: a lease taken on an existing task must reach the Observer, not just a task that appears.

The live watcher decided "changed" from row counts, status tallies and aggregates. A lease acquisition
changes none of those: it rewrites `lease_holder`, bumps `fencing_token` and moves `lease_expires_at` on a
row that already exists. Measured before this gate existed, writing a checkpoint, holder and fencing token
onto a live task left the sidecar's canonical fingerprint byte-identical (`fingerprint_changed=False`,
`differing_keys=[]`), so a desktop user watched a run they believed was queued.

An earlier revision of the fix also gated the whole content read behind `PRAGMA data_version`, and three
deliberate guards in `test_sidecar_v3_snapshot.py` went red: a watcher that only reads when some other
connection commits cannot prove that its readback works, cannot notice its own failure to publish, and
cannot be seen entering the read it is supposed to block in. That optimisation was measured as unnecessary
cost and has been removed; the witness below is the fix.

Evidence level: SYNTHETIC/INTEGRATED locally (two `CanonicalStore` connections on one runtime root), not
native executor evidence.
