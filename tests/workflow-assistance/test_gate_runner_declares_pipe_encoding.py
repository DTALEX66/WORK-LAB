"""Gate: no text-mode subprocess pipe in tracked Python may decode with the host locale.

Measured 2026-10-08: the canonical aggregate gate produced **no receipt at all**. It raised
`TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "NoneType") to str` in `_run_governance_batch`, and the same
mechanism one gate further down (`run_root_governance_suite.py`) would have followed. The chain:
`subprocess.run(..., text=True)` with no `encoding=` decodes with the locale, which on this host is cp936,
while mandatory modules print Chinese failure text under a pinned `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`. On the invalid
byte, subprocess's own `_readerthread` raised `UnicodeDecodeError`; the threading module printed it and the
thread died, so `communicate()` returned **None** for that stream. The crash named neither codec nor module,
and three sibling tests failed with `TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable`, looking like
broken assertions when nothing was asserting anything. Measured in one healthy call: stdout a 100,374-char
str, stderr None.

CI on Ubuntu could never show this -- its locale already matches the child -- so the guard is structural
rather than behavioural and covers every tracked `.py` file, not just the ones that crashed: a gate's
receipt is only as reliable as the pipes that read it.

The sibling gate `test_workflow_locale_discipline_gate.py` polices the *recorded CI commands* for the same
class; this one polices the pipes the code itself opens.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
