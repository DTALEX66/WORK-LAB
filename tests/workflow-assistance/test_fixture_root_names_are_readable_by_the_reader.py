"""Gate: a fixture root must be readable by the evidence reader that shares the project boundary.

This is the member of the random-name flake class that actually caused a red on a green tree. Measured
2026-10-08, on commit `3700cb53` with every other gate green:

    FAIL: test_every_refusal_is_typed_and_carries_no_content (test_evidence_range_reader.RefusalTests)
    AssertionError: 'SENSITIVE_NAME' != 'NOT_A_FILE'

`test_evidence_range_reader` creates its fixture with `project_temp.fixture_dir(prefix="range-reader-")`
and then asserts that reading the *fixture root* is refused as `NOT_A_FILE`. `tempfile.mkdtemp` appends
eight random characters drawn from `[a-z0-9_]`; `evidence_range_reader.name_is_sensitive` splits each
path component on `[^a-z0-9]+` and refuses a component holding a whole sensitive word; and
`SENSITIVE_WORDS` contains two- and three-letter tokens. So a suffix shaped like `a1_db_2c` makes the
fixture root itself a credential-looking name, the reader answers `SENSITIVE_NAME` before it ever asks
whether the handle is a file, and the assertion goes red for a reason that has nothing to do with the
code under test. Because the reader judges *every* ancestor, anything created under such a root is
refused with it — the exposure is not limited to one directory-handle test.

Two fixes were available. Loosening the matcher would weaken the owner's no-read law, and teaching one
test to dodge its own fixture name would leave the other call sites exposed to the same coin toss —
measured 2026-10-08: 53 `fixture_dir` calls pass a literal prefix (44 distinct prefixes), and the census
below checks every one of them. The rule stays; the helper that mints the name now asks the rule before
handing the root out, and this module pins that it cannot hand out a root the reader refuses.

The 1-in-20,000 rate and the `db`-only collision vocabulary are measured on this host the same day by
`.project-local/runs/qoder-20261008-d/probe_refusal_name_flake.py` and recorded as ERR-215.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
