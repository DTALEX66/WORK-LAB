"""Negative controls for the live-content-divergence rule (audit F04).

F04 found that the deployed copy of `windows-development-environment` is ahead of
the repository source: 145 lines versus 142, including two lesson entries (30 and 31)
and a `references/frontend-baseline-contract.md` that the repository does not have.
A digest comparison cannot see that, and the sanctioned single-direction publish
would overwrite the deployed file and destroy all of it.

The rule that must hold is therefore about actionability, not existence: if an entry
declares that the deployed copy is ahead, the declaration has to name the content, a
remediation path, and the impact of a redeploy — otherwise it records a loss without
making it fixable.

Synthetic fixtures plus one live assertion. Nothing is written.
