"""Gate: the compile step must cover every tracked Python file, and must use a check that can fail.

Two measured defects from 2026-10-08 live here.

First, coverage. `tracked_python_files()` enumerated five roots and the gate called the result the
repository's syntax check. A mechanical edit then put `keyword argument repeated` into
`apps/observer/scripts/write_artifact_receipt.py`, a file no local suite imports; the canonical gate printed
PASS and CI went red on `SyntaxError` in the observer fail-fast group. A check over 5 of the repo's roots is
not a repo-wide check no matter what it is named -- the tree has 644 tracked `.py` files across
`apps/`, `services/`, `scripts/ci`, `scripts/audit`, `scripts/maintenance`, `integrations/` and `tests/ci`.

Second, the guard that let the bad edit through: `ast.parse` does **not** reject a repeated keyword
argument. Measured on this machine's interpreter: `ast.parse` accepted the duplicate and `compile()` raised
`SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated: errors`. So "validated by re-parsing" was a weaker claim than it
sounded, and any tool of mine that guards a source rewrite with `ast.parse` alone can ship exactly this.
The control test below pins that difference so it cannot be forgotten again.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
