"""Gate: a registry version claim must be backed by the receipt that produced it.

`provenance.version` is allowed to carry only a natively verified value, and AG-07 gave it a structured
`version_readback` so drift is machine-checkable. Five entries were filled on 2026-10-07 from a Windows
version-resource read, so the claim now has an upstream artifact. This gate is what makes that pairing
enforceable instead of a promise in prose: a version without a matching, un-launched receipt fails, and so
does a version readback that quietly promotes a detection state a hash was supposed to own.
