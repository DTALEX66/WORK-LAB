"""Gate: the committed CURRENT_STATE projection must describe the tree that carries it.

Why this file exists: `python scripts/ci/generate_current_state.py --check-current` is a command the
GitHub workflow runs (`.github/workflows/work-lab-gate.yml`, the `Run current state tests` step of the
integration job) and NO local gate member ran. At 47d13507 that asymmetry produced the exact signature
this repo has recorded before -- local governance gate `GATE_EXIT=0`, CI red:

    CURRENT_STATE_FRESHNESS_FAIL source-digest-mismatch: recorded=3992b069931e recomputed=55f3237b0127

Both machines recomputed the same digest, so the check is not machine-dependent: the published
projection was simply stale, and it went stale because `.githooks/pre-commit` -- whose whole job is to
regenerate it at commit time -- had been a silent no-op (bare `python` on a PATH that has none,
`git add` of the pre-convergence `00-governance/generated/…` paths, and a shell script checked out with
CRLF because it has no extension). See ERR-261.

The negative control points `--check-current` at a scratch COPY of the projection with a planted digest,
so the branch that convicts staleness is proven to fire rather than assumed from the CI log.
