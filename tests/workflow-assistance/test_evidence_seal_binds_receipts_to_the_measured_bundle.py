"""The evidence seal must be able to tell a stale receipt from a live one -- and to be proved unable to lie.

Why this exists: on 2026-10-10 the Observer `dist` was rebuilt after every screenshot, geometry, legibility,
DPI and keyboard receipt in `.project-local/artifacts/wui-20261009` had already been written. Nothing in the
tree noticed, and nothing could have: a render receipt named no bundle, so "measured" and "measured against
bytes that a rebuild replaced an hour later" were the same shape on disk. `scripts/audit/seal_wui_evidence.py`
now classifies every artifact BOUND / STALE / UNBOUND against the build that exists right now.

A classifier that cannot fail is decoration, so the load-bearing assertions here are the negative ones: the
seal must refuse a receipt that names a different build, must refuse one that names nothing at all, and must
not seal a picture whose parent receipt went stale. Everything runs against synthetic trees in a temp dir --
this test does not need the real `dist`, so it stays checkout-verifiable on a CI runner.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
