"""WUI-15: `workflow/snapshot/v3` has a JSON Schema in the contract SSOT, and three spellings answer to it.

Before this file the snapshot's shape lived in two places that nothing compared: the Python producer
(`packages/client-neutral-core/scripts/snapshot_api.py`) plus its semantic validator, and a hand-maintained
TypeScript model (`apps/observer/frontend/src/types.ts`). That is how ERR-225 happened — the producer emitted
`entryProbe`/`versionDrift` the front model never declared, so the facts could not be rendered and every gate
stayed green. Registering the schema in `.project/governance/contracts/contract-catalog.json` gave the shape an
authority; this file proves the authority is not decorative by checking it against both consumers.

What is deliberately NOT duplicated here: the semantic invariants (capability-ladder monotonicity, checkpoint
digest shape, duplicate handles, truncation without an ordering key) stay in `snapshot_validator.py`, which
expresses rules JSON Schema cannot state. The schema owns the key set, each key's optionality and the primitive
types; this test owns the claim that the schema, the producer and the front model agree.

Two findings this test produced on its first runs, both recorded rather than patched away:
  * `coverage.scope` is `None` in the producer's minimal output. The schema's first draft said `string`, read
    off a single full readback. The front model was already right (`types.ts` said `string | null`), so the
    schema was the wrong party and is the one that changed.
  * `GitMatchState` declared `'MATCH' | 'UNVERIFIED' | 'DRIFT' | 'UNKNOWN'` while `_git_match_state` returns
    six values, three of which were un-declarable and two of which could never arrive. The union and five test
    fixtures moved to the producer's real vocabulary; `test_git_match_state_union_covers_every_producer_branch`
    is the guard that keeps the three sides together.

# The rule "no v3 snapshot object is embedded in the production front" is NOT re-implemented here. It already
# lives in apps/observer/tests/test_production_surface_static_contract.js, which anchors on the assignment
# shape (`schemaVersion: "workflow/snapshot/v3"` as a property of a payload) precisely so that api.ts's own
# parseSnapshotPayload — which COMPARES the id — is not convicted. A first draft of this file grepped for the
# bare string instead and failed on types.ts, api.ts and the excluded fixture directory: three correct hits
# and a false premise. One guard per question, and the disagreement is recorded rather than duplicated.
