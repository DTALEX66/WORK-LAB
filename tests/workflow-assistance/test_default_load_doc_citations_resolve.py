"""Gate: the documents a new session is told to read must be followable, not just quotable.

WUI-17's scope is deliberately narrow -- "only handle consumers that still affect default loading". The
highest-leverage such consumer is the audit bootstrap chain itself: `AGENTS.md` tells a session to read
seven documents in order, and those documents cite paths. Measured 2026-10-10, 56 of 201 citations in that
chain were names a reader could not open from the repository root (bare filenames, front-end-relative
`src/...`), and one document pointed at `HISTORICAL-KEY-POINTS.md` without saying it lives under
`docs/history/owner-inputs/`. The chain still "worked" for me because I already knew where things were --
which is exactly the property a default-load document must not have.

So the rule: every backticked path citation in the scope resolves to a file in the working tree, uniquely;
a citation that means a CLASS (`SKILL.md` for every skill, `BOUNDARY.md` for each service boundary) or an
out-of-repo file (Hermes Home's live `config.yaml`) must be declared in the tool's allowance map with a
reason, and every allowance must still be IN USE or the run goes red. Frozen history is excluded from
name-suggestion on purpose: a current sentence never means the 2026-10-09 cutover copy.
