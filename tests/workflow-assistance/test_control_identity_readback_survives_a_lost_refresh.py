"""WUI-10: the managed command boundary can be RE-QUERIED by the identity it already used.

The taskpack acceptance for this slice is one authorized transaction proven four ways — positive success,
conflict, refusal, recovery — plus the rule that the server checks actor / scope / prior state / version /
idempotency. The inbound owner material (WL-REC-0103 §6, judged in
`docs/current/ui-priority-20261009/UI-V2-INTAKE-20261010.md`) adds three constraints, and the second one is
what this module buys:

  后台刷新丢失时保留操作身份并查询同一操作，禁止以新幂等键自动重复写入。

Measured before this module: the control service served exactly two read endpoints (`descriptor`, `health`)
and the shell minted a fresh idempotency key in `main()` on EVERY page load. So a reload after a submit
left the operator with no answer to "did that write happen?" and a page that would send a NEW identity on
the next click. The write side already refused a foreign key on an existing task_id, which stops a silent
duplicate — it does not tell the operator anything, and "the record is there, and here is what it says"
was simply not obtainable.

`GET /api/control/operations/<task_id>` is that answer, and the tests below pin the four things that make
it honest rather than a convenience:

1. it reads the ONE canonical store and the append-only receipts — no second ledger, no in-memory table;
2. its three outcomes are separate (`写入唯一账本` / `原生加载读回` / `目标行为确认`), and a landed write
   CONFIRMS only the first; the other two report the live support level of the operations that would have
   to produce them, so this answer cannot rot into a claim that outlives the gap;
3. replaying the identity it returned adds no second row, and a NEW key on the same task_id is refused
   while the row count stays at one;
4. it exposes nothing the read-only projection did not already expose: no checkpoint VALUES (the goal text
   stays in the store), and it is loopback-gated exactly like the write path.

The answer shape is inline, the same disposition `worklab/control-error/v1` already has — it is not
registered in `.project/governance/contracts/contract-catalog.json`, and that is recorded as a deviation
rather than smuggled in as "46 contracts".

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
