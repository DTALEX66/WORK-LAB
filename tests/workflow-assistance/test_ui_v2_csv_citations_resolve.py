"""Gate: every path cited in the two inbound v2 CSVs resolves, or is declared ABSENT.

These two files (40-row interface binding matrix, 44-row acceptance checklist) are the traceability
artifacts the owner's pack asked for, and I filled them from research reports. That is exactly where a
wrong path does the most damage: a citation that does not resolve reads as provenance. Measured
2026-10-10, after the rows were written: 58 of 232 citations were shorthand (a bare filename, or `src/...`
relative to the front end) that a reader following them from the repository root cannot open, and one
named `apps/observer/frontend/src/lib/shared_rule_adaptation.ts` -- a file that has never existed, carried
in from a transcribed subagent report nobody re-checked (ERR-239).

So the rule is: a citation either resolves to a file in this repository, or is prefixed `ABSENT:` to say
the producer does not exist. The predicate is exercised against synthetic cells too, because a scanner that
finds nothing also "passes".

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.

        Two claims, only one of which is a repository fact, and the test used to assert them as if they were
        the same: `present > 0` required this box to still hold the round's receipts, so a runner that creates
        its own `.project-local/` (CI writes gate logs there) reached the assertion with nothing cited-present
        and failed at 47d13507 with `0 not greater than 0 : no runtime receipt is cited at all`. What is
        verifiable from the checkout is that the tables DO cite runtime receipts -- that is the counter that
        must not be decoration. Whether each cited receipt is real bytes is a fact about a machine, so it is
        judged on a machine that holds any of them, and reported as unjudgable on one that holds none
        (ERR-142's rule: answer existence from the repository, and say so when the box cannot answer).
