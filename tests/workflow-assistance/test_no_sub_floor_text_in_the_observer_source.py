"""Gate: the 12px type floor holds in the source, not only in the lanes the browser happened to render.

`scripts/audit/text_legibility_via_cdp.py` measures the shipped bundle, but one page load paints the
active lanes of one view. The floor it enforces was set by DESIGN.md for every screen, and 125
`text-[9px]/[10px]/[11px]` utilities once sat across 30 files, most of them behind navigation. This
guard is the cheap half: no browser, every file, run in the canonical gate.

The pinned skin is the one place a sub-12px declaration may survive — `b10.css` is verbatim by
decision D-11 and cannot be edited. It is therefore not exempt: each such declaration must be
overridden by name in `l10b-shell.css` at or above the floor, so "we cannot change it" can never
quietly become "so nobody did".
