"""Mandatory gate: a synthetic secret must not survive ingest into canonical state.

WUI-18's canary clause says the canary uses *synthetic* secrets -- nothing real is planted, and nothing
planted may be stored. The store has always refused a field NAMED like a credential
(``{"api_key": ...}``), so this gate aims at the shape it could not see: a provider token carried as a
VALUE under an ordinary field. Measured 2026-10-10, ``collect_usage_files`` turns a foreign ``usage.jsonl``
line into a canonical record with whatever ``provider``/``model``/``note`` strings it found, so a key hiding
in one of those fields used to be written to ``canonical.sqlite`` and then projected to the Observer.

The negative controls are the point: each planted shape has to be refused, and the two shapes a real
repository is full of -- a 64-hex error fingerprint and a 40-hex commit SHA -- have to keep passing. A guard
that refused those would have broken the worker loop, which is how it was found (an existing
``test_durable_worker`` case convicted it on the first run).
