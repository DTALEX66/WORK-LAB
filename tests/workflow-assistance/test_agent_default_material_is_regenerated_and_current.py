"""Gate: the default agent material says what this project is now, and every path it cites is real.

Why this exists (WUI-16): `.agents/skills/work-lab-workflow/SKILL.md` is the file a new session reads by
default. It was generated 2026-09-xx and still described the pre-UI-priority state -- `services/ + packages/
+ integrations/` as the owner (the machine authority says exactly two module roots), `E:\\` as the only
forbidden drive (both E: and F: are), and nothing about client-neutral positioning, the three-project
boundary, desktop-only scope, or the truth discipline that the whole project rests on. A stale default
document is worse than an absent one: every new session inherits its wrongness without noticing.

The two clauses the taskpack asks for are checked as behaviour, not as prose review:
  * "regenerate from current source, two runs with no unexplained drift" -> the generator is run twice here
    and the emitted bytes must be identical, and the header's content hash must equal the hash of the body
    under it;
  * "traceability gaps shown" -> every repository-relative path the skill cites must be a tracked file, so a
    reference that no longer resolves fails the gate instead of silently misleading a reader.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
