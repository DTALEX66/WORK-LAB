"""Gate: the sidecar's read-only 405 must survive a keep-alive connection at the byte level.

The sidecar serves HTTP/1.1, so a connection stays open after a response. A refused write that leaves its
request body in the buffer makes the NEXT response on that connection begin with the caller's JSON, and a
client then reads a broken status line where the read-only contract promises 405. The product already
drains (``refuse_write`` -> ``_drain_request_body``), but until now the only proof at the byte level was on
the Control server, and ERR-187's own boundary claimed the sidecar needed a subprocess boot because its
handler class is nested inside the serving function. That claim was never tested: ``create_server`` is a
module-level function that binds port 0, so this test speaks raw bytes to it in-process.

The control case is the reason to believe the rest. A deliberately naive refusal (deny without draining)
is served on the same client code path, and the second request must come back desynchronized. An assertion
that cannot fail guards nothing.

Evidence level: SYNTHETIC/INTEGRATED local loopback, one process, one runtime root.
