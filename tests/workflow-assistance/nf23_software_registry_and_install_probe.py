"""Regression tests for two silent-truth defects found on 2026-10-01.

1. BOM-broken software registry. `config/software-registry.json` was written
   with a UTF-8 BOM. `composition_root._load_software_registry()` reads it with
   `encoding="utf-8"`, so `json.loads` raised
   `JSONDecodeError: Unexpected UTF-8 BOM`, and the bare `except` returned `[]`.
   The consequence was invisible: the snapshot's `software[]` projection was
   always empty, so the Observer's Software lane could only ever show UNKNOWN
   even though 7 software entries are registered. Nothing anywhere failed.

2. First-existing-directory-wins install probing. `platform_discovery._probe_install`
   took the first declared root that merely EXISTS and never expanded
   environment variables. DSH therefore resolved to the stale leftover
   `D:/All projects/DSH` directory (now holding only a .dsh data folder) and was
   reported `SINGLE_UNVERIFIED`, while the real official install sat unprobed at
   the vendor default path.

These tests are read-only and assert the honest contract, not an implementation.
