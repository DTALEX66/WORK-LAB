"""Gate: a write made by another writer must reach the Observer as a NEW revision, not just new content.

The journey the product promises ends with "Observer sees the same task at a new revision". Content
visibility and revision advancement are different guarantees: a snapshot fetched between the write and
the watcher's next tick shows the record with the OLD revision, which is exactly what an early read
looks like. That mistake was made with an ad-hoc probe and reported as a product gap, so this gate now
holds the two apart on every run.

Shape: one project-local runtime root, a real ``WorkflowSidecar`` with live updates, and a SECOND
``CanonicalStore`` connection standing in for the Control service (the sidecar's watcher is designed for
deltas written by a separate writer). Evidence level: SYNTHETIC/INTEGRATED locally — it is not native
executor evidence and is not claimed as such.

Discovered dynamically by ``run_quality_gate.py governance``.
