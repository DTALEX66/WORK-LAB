"""WUI-06 / WUI-15 · the frontend's card type must cover every key the producer emits.

Why this exists: `adapter_capability_projection.py` added `entryProbe` and `versionDrift` to every
capability card, and `apps/observer/frontend/src/types.ts` never learned about them. Nothing broke — a
missing field is invisible to a TypeScript interface that is hand-maintained, and the UI simply stopped
being able to render a fact the backend already answers. That is the silent half of a front/back contract:
an extra field in the payload is harmless, a field the type does not name is unrenderable, and neither
direction is checked by any schema because the v3 contract is code plus tests, not a JSON Schema
(`apps/observer/schemas/*.json` describe the legacy v2 `/api/dashboard` payload).

The test therefore reads both sides from source and fails on the set difference. It also refuses to pass
on a parse failure: the producer set must be at least as large as the number this file measured, so a
refactor that moves the `cards.append({...})` literal makes the test red rather than vacuously green.
