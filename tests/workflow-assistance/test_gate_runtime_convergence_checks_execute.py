"""Gate: every runtime-convergence check must actually run, not just exist.

Why this file exists: `packages/client-neutral-core/scripts/verify_gate_runtime_convergence.py` carries
ten `check_N()` functions, and three of them were migrated to `project_temp.fixture_root(...)` in
d22d21eb while their `import tempfile` line stayed behind -- so the name they used was never bound in
that scope. CI met it at 82a24df7 as soon as the earlier stage stopped failing first:

    File ".../verify_gate_runtime_convergence.py", line 112, in check_5_no_fabricated_exact
        with project_temp.fixture_root(prefix='gate-runtime-conv-') as td:
    NameError: name 'project_temp' is not defined
    QUALITY_GATE_FAIL gate=runtime-convergence exit_code=1

Nothing caught it locally because the local run had been `governance`, and this verifier is a different
stage. A check that raises is not a check that failed: it answered no question at all, and a report
built from ten claims is only worth what the ten calls returned. So the gate here is the call itself --
drive every check, require a report-shaped dict from each, and require the aggregate to name all ten.
