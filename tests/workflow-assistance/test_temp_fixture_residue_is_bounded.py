"""Gate: the bounded temp root must not accumulate orphaned fixtures.

The creation half of this boundary was gated long ago (``test_temp_fixture_stays_inside_the_boundary``
refuses a ``mkdtemp`` with no ``dir=``), and the at-exit sweeper in ``project_temp`` does release what
its own process created — measured 2026-10-08 by running ``test_cleanup.py`` (17 tests, 17 fixtures,
the ``wlsim-*`` count unchanged before and after). What nothing guarded was the *orphan*: a gate job
that is killed, times out or crashes never reaches at-exit, and its fixture roots then have no owner.
The pile it left was 4811 directories / 531.7 MiB under ``.project-local/runs/tmp``, 676 of them
carrying a nested ``.git`` whose mode-0444 objects made even an explicit ``shutil.rmtree`` fail with
WinError 5, which ``ignore_errors=True`` had been swallowing. It was reclaimed by
``scripts/maintenance/release_temp_fixture_residue.py --apply`` (4796 dirs, 556,311,265 bytes freed,
0 failures, manifest under ``.project-local/artifacts/temp-residue-reclaim/``).

This gate is what keeps it from regrowing. It measures the effect rather than the code pattern, so a
new call site that leaks some other way is still caught, and it uses the reclaim tool's own census and
age floor so the two cannot drift. The floor (6 hours) is what makes the check safe on a shared
checkout: a fixture belonging to a run that is live right now is never counted, and the planted-fixture
tests below prove both halves of that.

Discovered dynamically by ``run_quality_gate.py governance``.
