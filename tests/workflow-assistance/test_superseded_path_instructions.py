"""Gate: a reader-facing document must not tell a reader to operate at a path that no longer exists.

U02's read-only path convergence was recorded as done for README and PROJECT_POSITIONING while five
documents under `docs/current/` still said "run from `10-workflow/workflow-assistance`" — a directory
the 2026-09 convergence stopped tracking. One of them paired that instruction with
`python services/authority/machine_identity.py`, a repository-root path, so the published recipe
could not run as written at all.

The rule is stated as a shape, not a blocklist of two files: a superseded path may appear in a
reader-facing document only on a line that also says it is superseded. That keeps honest history
("2026-09 收敛前为 …") and rejects the imperative form ("从 X 运行：").
