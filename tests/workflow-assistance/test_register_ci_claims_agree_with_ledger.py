"""Gate: a register row's CI claim must agree with the ledger, without touching the network.

Measured 2026-10-08 by comparing every CI-shaped status token in the live register against GitHub's own
check-runs at the SHA each row pins: 13 rows make such a claim and **4 of them were wrong**. Two were stale
in the harmless-looking direction ("exact-SHA CI not run" at `5037dd2` and `6f323a3`, which each had 24 of
24 runs succeed); two were worse, because a red verdict had been written as an absence -- `f9f38d6` and
`9bbadaf` both had 4 failed runs and 20 successes, and the rows said "not run (no commit authorization)" and
"not read". An absence is unfalsifiable, so nobody re-checked it; a number is not.

CI itself cannot reach GitHub, and a gate that needs the network becomes a flake or a silent skip. So this
gate enforces the part that is decidable from tracked records alone, which is exactly the agreement between
the two authority surfaces:

  * a row may claim green at a SHA only if some ledger record carries `verifiedCommit` == that SHA -- the
    stamper writes that field only when every run at the head completed green, so it is the repository's own
    proof of an exact-SHA verdict;
  * a row that says CI was not run / not read / owed must not name a SHA the ledger has verified, because the
    ledger would then be holding evidence the row denies exists;
  * a row that claims red at a SHA must not coincide with a `verifiedCommit` at that same SHA.

The live comparison (asking GitHub what really happened) is `scripts/ci/verify_register_ci_claims_live.py`;
it refuses on a host with no credentials and is run by hand, with the result written into the row it
contradicts.

Discovered dynamically by `run_quality_gate.py governance`.
