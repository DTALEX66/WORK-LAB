"""Route guard: a member that carries both shapes must go to the runner that sees all of it.

`services/orchestration/run_quality_gate.py` classifies each mandatory member from its syntax tree and
addresses unittest members by module stem, pytest members and check scripts by repository path. NF31
(2026-10-26) replaced a substring classifier that sent genuine pytest modules to `python -m unittest`,
where they imported cleanly, printed nothing and exited 0 -- a batch that reports PASS while executing
nothing. The rule that fixed it is one line long (module-level `def test_*` wins over a TestCase class),
and until now nothing tested it: reordering those two returns would re-open the whole leak with every
gate still green.

Two things make this a check rather than an echo. The shape table drives the shipped classifier over
sources written here, and the population sweep decides "this file must not go to unittest" from its own
syntax walk -- not from the classifier's answer -- so the two can disagree. Verified by planting the
fault: swapping the classifier's two returns fails `shape='mixed'` and the population sweep both.
