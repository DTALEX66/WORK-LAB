"""Gate: no live instruction surface may tell a reader to run a path that does not exist.

U02 is path convergence. ERR-115 recorded that `scripts/workflow/` had moved out of the repository,
round D repaired the scripts and skills that called it — and the *documents* were never re-asked, so
77 command lines across `docs/current/`, the managed skill references, README and AGENTS.md still
instructed a path that no longer exists. This gate makes that question machine-checkable instead of
dependent on someone remembering to ask it.

Surfaces are the ones a reader acts on today. Frozen narrative (docs/history, taskpacks/history,
reports/audit-archive, knowledge-staging) is out of scope on purpose, and JSON ledgers are scanned by
their own promise-resolving gate rather than line-by-line, because a `command` field is history while
`lifecycle.regressionCommand` is a promise (ERR-130).
