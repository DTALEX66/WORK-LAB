"""WUI-21: the isolated-trial read models reach the v3 snapshot, and stay honest when they cannot.

The contract pair (worklab/operation-progress/v1, worklab/isolated-trial/v1) and their producer already
existed (2026-10-10); what did not exist was a carrier. The three pages therefore had nothing to read,
and the temptation was to invent fields in the UI. These tests pin the carrier instead:

  * the sections are PRESENT and validate against the closed snapshot schema;
  * every item is the contract document itself (schema_version spoken), not a paraphrase;
  * when the ledger cannot answer, the answer is UNKNOWN / NO_PRODUCER — never PASSED, and the gap list
    names what has no producer;
  * absent stays absent: a snapshot built without the producer carries no key at all, because "the
    producer was never wired" and "the producer ran and there is nothing" are different statements.
