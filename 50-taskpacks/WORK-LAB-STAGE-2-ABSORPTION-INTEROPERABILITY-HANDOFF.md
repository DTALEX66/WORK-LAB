## Task pack identity

```yaml

The attachment is the authoritative task-pack source. This tracked file is the
repository-local final handoff and is not a substitute for the attachment. The
attachment's historical `observed_remote_head` is comparison evidence only;
never reset, overwrite, delete, or abandon local work to match it.

## Final reconciliation

The ordered successor queue below was reconciled on 2026-08-08. Completion is
proved by the local Task Ledger, per-task verifier/tests/handoffs, merged PR
aggregate evidence, and the NX-720 exact-tree review. The local ignored Ledger
remains the machine-readable task-state authority; this document is the human
handoff projection.

Final reviewed tree: `4268c1dcbeec412e33748a7ffbef4d6e34fe8bd4`

Final boundaries: exactly two active modules, no tracked transferred scope,
no tracked forbidden artifacts, and no live/provider/paid/human calibration
claim. Release approval remains `PENDING_HUMAN_APPROVAL`.

## Start gate

Stage 2 remains queued until all Gate A conditions are satisfied:

- predecessor Task Ledger, current tree digest, worktree status, and active
  writer lease have been reconciled;
- predecessor WL-000 through WL-820 has a machine-readable state export that
  distinguishes complete, partial, not-started, blocked, and deferred;
- CURRENT_STATE, the two active module contracts, Adapter Registry, event schemas,
  and Observer read-only state are readable;
- predecessor P0 ownership is explicit for security, single-writer,
  Task Ledger, CI watcher, event contracts, and Observer read-only boundaries;
- no second writer, second worktree, or parallel task modifies this checkout;
- NX-000 confirms one owner, task ID, and write path for every overlap.

If Gate A is not satisfied, only an `NX-000-PREDECESSOR-GAP-REPORT` may be
created. No Stage 2 implementation write may begin. At registration time the
predecessor worktree is dirty, so Stage 2 stays in the waiting state.

## Scope and exclusions

- The only active canonical modules remain:
  - `10-workflow/workflow-assistance`
  - `30-observer/work-lab-observer`
- Do not add an Agent, chat UI, model gateway, LLMOps platform, task platform,
  database platform, second task runtime, second memory service, second
  Observer UI, or fourth product.
- Do not auto-install unknown Skills/MCP/clients. Do not read credentials,
  auth stores, prompts/responses, full session bodies, OAuth tokens,
  Credential Manager, or private quota endpoints.
- Do not default-install collectors, Langfuse, Phoenix, OpenLIT, LiteLLM Proxy,
  Mem0/Graphiti/Temporal/Trigger.dev/Dagu services. Absorb only audited
  methods, contracts and fixtures.
- Do not vendor complete upstream repositories or commit node_modules, caches,
  downloaded binaries, or code with unknown licensing.
- Commit, push, PR, merge, release, Hermes live/global apply, paid-provider
  smoke, real OS profile writes, destructive archive work, and human aesthetic
  calibration remain separately approval-gated.

## Completion definition

Stage 2 may stop only at:

```text
LOCAL_VERIFIED_READY_FOR_USER_APPROVAL
```

Only real implementations, fixtures, negative controls, readback and source/
license evidence qualify. Links, README entries, directories, registry rows,
download counts, or research notes do not prove adapter, conformance, privacy,
round-trip, production-output, rollback, or human-calibration completion.

## Final next action

No further Stage 2 implementation task is queued. A user-approved release,
live/global apply, paid-provider smoke, real-device validation, and human
visual calibration remain separate approval-gated actions and are not implied
by this handoff.
