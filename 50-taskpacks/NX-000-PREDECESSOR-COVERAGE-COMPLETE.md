# NX-000 — Predecessor Coverage, Inheritance Matrix, Overlap Dedupe

**Status:** `COMPLETED`
**Task pack:** `WORK-LAB-STAGE-2-ABSORPTION-INTEROP`
**Date:** 2026-08-08

## 1. Gate A assessment — SATISFIED

All six Gate A conditions are now satisfied:

| # | Condition | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Predecessor Task Ledger / tree / worktree / writer lease reconciled | ✅ worktree clean, M-310 merged via PR #9 (`ce66e7c`), single writer |
| 2 | WL-000..WL-820 machine-readable state export | ✅ `WL-000-WL-820-STATUS.json` v2, coverage_complete=True, 30 tasks (26 VERIFIED, 4 SUPERSEDED_MOVED) |
| 3 | CURRENT_STATE / contracts / Adapter Registry / event schemas / Observer readable | ✅ contracts=28, Observer read-only PASS |
| 4 | Predecessor P0 ownership explicit | ✅ single_writer=true, observer read-only |
| 5 | No second writer/worktree | ✅ confirmed |
| 6 | NX-000 confirms one owner/task/write-path per overlap | ✅ inheritance matrix complete, no duplicate owner |

## 2. Predecessor coverage

- Authority: `WORK-LAB-AUTHORITATIVE-MASTER-CONTINUATION-2026-08-07`, **Appendix A** (full 30-task WL graph), SHA `244a26f9...`.
- Export: `.hermes/task-artifacts/gate-a/WL-000-WL-820-STATUS.json` (v2).
- Coverage: **30/30 WL tasks mapped**; `coverage_complete=true`.
- 4 WL tasks `SUPERSEDED_MOVED`: WL-600/610/620/630 → transferred to Open Design (not re-run in WORK-LAB).

## 3. Inheritance matrix for Stage 2

| NX | State |
|---|---|
| NX-000 | NEW |
| NX-100..NX-720 | INHERITED_VERIFIED (16) |

No `INHERITED_PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED_BY_PREDECESSOR`, or `DEFERRED`. Predecessor covers all Stage 2 dependencies.

Artifact: `.hermes/task-artifacts/gate-a/NX-000-PREDECESSOR-COVERAGE.json`.

## 4. Overlap dedupe

- No two Observer UI / event schema / Skill Registry / Task Ledger instances.
- WL-600/610/620/630 (Open Design / MINIGAME) → owned by `DTALEX66/OPEN-DESIGN-Assistance`, out of WORK-LAB scope.
- Single owner per feature: Workflow governs contracts/ledger/CI; Observer is read-only projection.

## 5. Next

Proceed to **NX-100** (cross-module Source Ledger V3), then NX-110, NX-200, ... NX-720 sequentially.
