"""Read-only projection state classification (integrated-taskpack NF-09).

Splits a client's observed state into five non-overlapping, evidence-backed
buckets so the Observer never shows a false LIVE and never conflates a real
zero with "unknown":

  LIVE          real collection, fresh + source-exact, authorized, >0 active.
  ACTUAL_ZERO   authorized, fresh + source-exact, and genuinely zero active —
                a real zero, distinct from UNKNOWN.
  STALE         evidence exists but is old / partial (broken chain, not live).
  UNKNOWN       no reliable evidence (chain broken or empty).
  UNAUTHORIZED  a client not in the authorized registry; its data is never
                counted as active (transferred / legacy projects excluded).

Every result carries its source time and scope.  The classifier is pure and
read-only: it returns evidence only, never a mutation surface, and cannot
change execution state (the "service interface stays read-only" guarantee is
locked separately via the projection's ``mutation_surface`` all-False set).
