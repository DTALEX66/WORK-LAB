"""Write a build-time input receipt next to the release binary.

ERR-105's remaining boundary was that a rollback to an older commit leaves
every input matching HEAD, so nothing in the tree evidences a change and a
superseded binary looks current. mtimes and `git diff` cannot see that; a
record of the bytes the build actually consumed can.

This is the build side's job, not the gate's: the writer runs immediately
after the compiler so the receipt attests to a build that was observed, and
`u19_webview_e2e.py` only ever reads it. A missing receipt is not an error —
the gate falls back to its content-evidence rule and says which basis decided.

v2 records two stages: the bytes the compiler consumed (rust, capabilities,
tauri.conf.json, the embedded dist) and the frontend build chain that produced
that bundle (source tree, entry html, vite/ts/postcss/tailwind configs, both
lockfiles, npm's installed-tree manifest). The second stage is what removes
the need for mtime between `frontend/src` and `frontend/dist`.
