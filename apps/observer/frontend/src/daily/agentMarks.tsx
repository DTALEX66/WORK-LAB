/**
 * Which software is an AGENT, and what it looks like.
 *
 * Two separate claims, one module, because they were being conflated on screen: the HUD drew every adapter
 * card the snapshot handed it, so GitHub -- whose client declares `role: "vcs_host"` in
 * `config/capability-matrix.json` -- appeared among the monitored agents, and every row carried the same
 * two-letter monogram, which identifies nothing.
 *
 * The predicate reads a declaration, not a name list. Two surfaces ask the question and each has its own
 * declaration: the software rows carry the registry's `category`
 * (`services/orchestration/composition_root.py::_build_software_projection`), and the adapter cards the HUD
 * is built from carry the capability matrix's `role`. Both are exposed below. `UNKNOWN` is deliberately not
 * an agent on either axis: "we do not know what this is" must not render as a monitored runtime.
 *
 * The marks are original glyphs, one character per agent, drawn here rather than fetched: shipping a
 * vendor's logo would be a trademark claim this project does not own, and the owner's alternative was
 * explicitly "宠物图标". A software id with no glyph gets the distinct UNMARKED figure -- never a letter
 * avatar, which is the thing that made every row look identical.
