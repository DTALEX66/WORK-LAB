// WUI-01/WUI-02 (taskpack 20261009) · the information-architecture model.
//
// Before this module the rail's grouping lived inside Sidebar.tsx as a literal, so "which lanes are
// daily destinations" was only answerable by reading a component, and the owner's route mapping
// (docs/history/owner-inputs/20261009/final-readable/inputs/frontend_route_mapping.proposed.csv) had no
// place to be encoded. This file is the single source: the rail, the command palette and the contract
// tests all read it, and the invariants are functions rather than magic numbers — the taskpack's rule is
// to repair the stale seven-group count assertion instead of pinning a permanent five.
//
// Two separations the product keeps insisting on:
//
// * DEFAULT NAVIGATION vs REGISTRY. A lane can leave the rail (workflow-editor: 退出默认导航) without
//   losing its deep link or its working implementation. `OFF_DEFAULT_NAV_IDS` is that statement, and it
//   is the only way a lane disappears from the rail.
// * DESTINATION vs LANE. The five destinations are a suggestion (WUI-01 says so explicitly), so they are
//   named here as data with their member lanes, and nothing in the app asserts "exactly five".
