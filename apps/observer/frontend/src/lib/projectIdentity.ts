// WUI-04 · project identity as the projection can actually answer it.
//
// The acceptance line says: 非Git/多目录/worktree/同名不合并. Read literally against the producer, that
// is a statement about what the UI may NOT do, because the v3 snapshot answers identity with exactly one
// key. Verified in `packages/client-neutral-core/scripts/snapshot_api.py` and
// `services/orchestration/composition_root.py`:
//
//   * `projectId` is the canonical store's primary key — the only unique identity that reaches the UI;
//   * `displayName` is NOT unique and is defaulted to the id when absent, so two rows can legitimately
//     carry the same name and three can carry the same directory;
//   * `identityState` only ever arrives as RESOLVED or UNRESOLVED — the resolver's CONFLICT state
//     (`project_identity_resolver.py:48`) is never projected;
//   * `repositories` is read with a default of `[]` from a row builder that never sets it, so an empty
//     list is a producer gap, NOT "this project has no repositories";
//   * `workingAreas` is aggregated from executions, so `[]` means no execution recorded one;
//   * there is no worktree id, no repository id and no per-project observation state in the payload.
//
// So this module does two things: it keys everything by `projectId`, and it names the identity questions
// the projection cannot answer as data the pages render — which is the only way the UI can say
// "同名不合并" truthfully instead of implying a resolution it never received.
