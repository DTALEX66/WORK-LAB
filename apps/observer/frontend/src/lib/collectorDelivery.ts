/**
 * WUI-18(e)/WUI-11: read the per-collector delivery and refusal section as three different statements.
 *
 * The snapshot's `collectors` key can be absent, an empty list, or a list of rows — and those mean
 * "health was never read", "health was read and no collector is registered", and "here is what each
 * collector delivered and refused". Collapsing the first two is the error WUI-11 refuses to render
 * (无数据 / 不存在 / 未连接 are separate explanations), so the classification lives here, tested, instead of
 * in a component's `??` chain.
 *
 * No percentage is computed, deliberately. The producer publishes `deliveredRows` and `refusedRows`; it does
 * not publish "rows offered" as its own figure, and a rate built from the two counters would be presented as
 * a loss ratio the payload never claimed. Counts are rendered as counts.
