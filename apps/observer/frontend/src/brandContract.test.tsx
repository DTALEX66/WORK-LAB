/**
 * G2 of the UI prompt pack: the console carries its own brand.
 *
 * The top bar had no brand mark at all. That matters most for the compact HUD, which renders no
 * rail, so that window had no identity; and the main window runs with `decorations:false`, so this
 * row IS the chrome. The palette single-source rule and the source-level sweeps for these
 * contracts live in tests/ci/test_desktop_only_shell.py, because `tsc -b` type-checks this
 * project without Node types.
