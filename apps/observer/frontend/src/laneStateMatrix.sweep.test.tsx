/** Per-lane state matrix: what each lane can actually render when data is absent or refused.
 *
 * The prompt's state list is ten states (success / empty / loading / offline / stale / unknown /
 * backend-not-implemented / permission-denied / error / cancelled / recovering). Two of them were never
 * measured per lane, and the gap matters in opposite directions:
 *
 *  - `loading` must not be painted as `unknown`-looking zero data, and must never show a success pill;
 *  - `permission-denied` may only appear on a lane that has an action to be denied. A read-only lane that
 *    renders a permission widget is faking a capability the product does not have — the same lie in the
 *    other direction.
 *
 * So this sweep measures every registry lane twice (no snapshot yet, and a refused-action snapshot),
 * prints the matrix it observed, and asserts only properties that are true for all lanes plus the two
 * per-lane rules above. It deliberately does not require a read-only lane to have a permission state.
