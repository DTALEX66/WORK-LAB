/**
 * WUI-14 · a new snapshot must not steal focus, selection, or reading position.
 *
 * The taskpack clause is 不抢焦点/选中/阅读位置. Two of the three are properties of a *live update*: the
 * user is mid-keystroke or mid-sentence when the projection arrives, and the screen must not move under
 * them. jsdom has no layout, so this file proves the mechanism that decides the pixel outcome — the
 * scrolling element and the text the user selected must survive the update as the SAME DOM nodes — and
 * the shipped production tree contains no `scrollTo`/`scrollTop =`/`removeAllRanges` call at all (grep
 * verified 2026-10-09 over `src/`), so node survival is the whole story. The pixel half is a real
 * browser's job, not this file's.
 *
 * The update is pushed through the real hook's own state setter rather than by re-rendering from the
 * test, because "the parent re-rendered harmlessly" is not the event the product has to survive.
