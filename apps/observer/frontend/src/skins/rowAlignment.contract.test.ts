/**
 * WUI-03 · stacked detail rows must actually stretch.
 *
 * `align-items` on a `.list-item` is decided by load order, and load order is exactly what the last two
 * cascade bugs in this skin turned on: `src/main.tsx` imports `index.css` (Tailwind utilities, where
 * `items-stretch` lives) BEFORE `skins/b10.css`, so a one-class `.list-item{align-items:center}` in the
 * pinned skin beats a one-class utility of equal specificity that arrived earlier. The result was
 * invisible to every text and contrast assertion — the label and the value were both present, they were
 * just centered, which is what the row layout was never meant to look like.
 *
 * So the guard is on the cascade itself: the shell must re-assert the alignment for a stacked row, and it
 * must keep doing so only while the pinned skin still fights it. If b10 stops declaring `align-items` on
 * `.list-item`, this test says the override is now unexplained rather than letting it rot into dead CSS.
