/**
 * AUXILIARY ENTRY CONTRACT (WL-REC-0103 §2 -- "诊断与隐私为辅助入口").
 *
 * The pack asks for two things that are easy to fake: a 诊断 entry and a 隐私 entry, grouped as auxiliary
 * rather than as destinations. This repo already owned both surfaces -- `monitoring` is the bounded
 * diagnostics lane WUI-11 shipped and `privacy` is the collection-lifecycle page WUI-12 shipped -- so the
 * correct change is a grouping, NOT a third projection and NOT a new lane id. The assertions below are
 * written so that each of the shortcuts I could have taken shows up as a red:
 *
 *   * inventing a `diagnostics` lane would duplicate 监控's projection (assertion 2 fails: an auxiliary id
 *     that is not a registry lane);
 *   * naming a group 辅助 without putting anything in it would leave the word unreachable (assertion 4);
 *   * asserting the palette's filter by re-typing its predicate would pass while the real search is blind,
 *     so the test imports `filterItems` from the overlay itself and drives a query that must return nothing.
 *
 * The word 诊断 is deliberately not inside either lane's own label (`监控`, `隐私与采集`); it lives in the
 * section caption, which is the second field the palette matches. That is the mechanism, and assertion 4
 * is what proves it is the mechanism rather than a coincidence of the label text.
