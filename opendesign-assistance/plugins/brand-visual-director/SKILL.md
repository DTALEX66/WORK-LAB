# Brand Visual Director

Use this skill inside Open Design for brand identity, VI direction, visual systems, key visuals, 2D graphic systems, social/print campaigns, and design-system starting points.

## Inputs to collect

- `brand`: name, category, existing assets.
- `audience`: users, buyers, visitors, internal team, public audience.
- `tone`: premium, official, tech, playful, cultural, industrial, editorial.
- `applications`: website, app, social, culture wall, exhibition, poster, deck, signage.
- `constraints`: colors, logo, language, format, production, legal/competitor avoid list.

## Design rules

1. Brand design must produce application rules, not only mood words.
2. Visual design needs one thesis, one focal system, and explicit typography hierarchy.
3. 2D work needs grid, shape language, stroke/type rules, and export specs.
4. Chinese and English typography must both be handled when relevant.
5. Avoid direct imitation of reference brands; borrow discipline, not identity.
